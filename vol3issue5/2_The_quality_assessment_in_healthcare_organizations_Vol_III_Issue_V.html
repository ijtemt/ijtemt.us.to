Paper Title : <br>The quality assessment in healthcare organizations</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper discusses three main approaches to quality assessment, such as: the organizational structure including human, physical and financial resources, necessary to health care; the care process referring to a sequence of actions or activities that transform inputs, provided by the physicians, in output received by patients; and the result denoting the output of the technical process, the benefit arising from the process as assessed by the patient according to its expectations. Health system reforms in recent decades have led to a serious attention of health professionals to improve the quality of health care, as well as to reduce costs.

  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;">&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  quality concept implies the assessment the care quality and the comparison of a  result to a objective. The need to systematically evaluate the care quality  arises from the need to identify and analyse the causes of the variations  observed in many aspects of health care in order to find improvement solutions.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  actions of quality evaluation and cost reduction are based on the comparison  between what is done and what should be done and on the implementation of  corrective actions (Jars-Guincestre, Durieux, 1998). The main steps of the  quality process are the identification of problems, the implementation of  appropriate actions, the extent of their impact on the quality of care and the  subsequent evaluation of these actions (Saulnier, 1998). The assessment may  concern three aspects of the health care system: structure and organization;  the processes; and results. These aspects are complementary: the assessment of  structures or processes must have impact on the results; if the assessment is  based on the measurement of results, the variations observed must have a direct  link with the quality of care, with reference to the structure, organization,  or procedures (Brook, McGlynn, Cleary, 1996).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  evaluation method is based on some key elements such as:</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Training for operators to identify problems and define behaviors aimed at their  solution;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Setting standards useful to analyze the operations to create the final result;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Ability to recognize the critical tasks in processes;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">- Capability  to assess the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed change;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Empowerment of the operators to cooperate on the basis of shared goals;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Creating a positive organizational climate (De Simone, 2013);</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Awareness of the importance of the quality role;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">-  Willingness to share information.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">This process collides with the method difficulty to  formalize and measure the components of the complex medical act. With  increasing of health care costs, funders of health care are interested in using  the most appropriate methods to collect information for regular clinical  practice. The measure of the quality of health care organizations is a  difficult task, especially for the lack of an integrated information system  allowing routine measure. Italian health system reforms in recent decades have  undoubtedly led to a more serious attention of health professionals to improve  the quality of health care, compatibly with the efficient management of health  care (De Simone, 2000). </p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  problem of quality evaluation in health care dates back to the work of the English  nurse Florence Nightingale in 1854 aimed to investigate the hypothesis  concerning the problems of hospital care during the Crimean War (Cohen, 1984).  Nightingale introduced the outcome indicators to measure mortality rates, check  the quality of patient care and demonstrate the need to reduce the spread of  infections. During the Crimean War, she gathered some statistics on the British  injured soldiers classifying them into two categories: the soldiers who died;  and the soldiers who were healed. Nightingale correlated these results to the  intensity and the quality of nursing care that the soldiers received and  demonstrated that the adequate nursing care resulted in a reduction of  mortality rates from 32% to 2%. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">In  1914, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, Ernest A. Codman, following  the trend of studies on outcome management, pointed out the result of patient  care was an effective indicator to assess the quality of care (Al-Assaf,  Schmele, 1993). The analysis of the final clinical outcome allowed to indicate  the presence of some problems and identify effective actions to prevent  problems in the future. Codman considered the rate of in-hospital mortality as  an easily measurable indicator to assess the delivered care and distinguished  two types of in-hospital mortality, inevitable mortality and intentional  mortality dependent on the medical care and the care provided by other health  professionals. The reflections of Codman, even dated back to a century ago',  are of great relevance today (Codman, 1986). Health care organizations must  declare their results and performance, analyze the results to identify  strengths and weaknesses and compare results with those of other health care  organizations. The hospitals had to publish reports to compare the results in  terms of efficiency, to measure outcomes effectiveness and reward staff.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  evaluation system shifted from the outcomes measurement to the comparison of  the care quality with predefined standards, through the analysis, monitoring  and evaluation of existing clinical practices, and therefore from the ex-post  control to prevention and planning. It&rsquo;s interesting to consider the commitment  of the American College of Surgeons in 1912 to standardize the structure and  way of working of hospitals, to ensure that institutions with higher ideals had  the right recognition by the professional community and the institutions with  lower standards are stimulated to improve the quality of their job. According  to the statement of the American College of Surgeons (origin of accreditation  in the U.S.A.), the continuous improvement of quality and the attention to  patients&rsquo; needs are key elements to improve the health care system. Although  the outcome indicators continued to be used in Europe and in the United States,  the trend began to shift towards the structure and process indicators. Health  professionals and researchers continued to collect data to measure outcomes and  use them to understand and control the quality of care.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  impetus for the study of the structure raised in the 1950 with the  establishment of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals which  published the first International Accreditation Standards for Hospitals,  concerning the minimum structural requirements and the skills of health  services organizations. This trend continued until 1970 in the United States,  with the raise of the Professional Standards Review Organizations which gave  emphasis to the process indicators to assess the quality of care provided to  patients (Al-Assaf, Schmele, 1993). </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  adoption of the control system of the correspondence of healthcare  organizations to quality and organizational criteria stems mainly by the  widespread of private health care organizations (profit or non profit). These  organizations in a regime of absolute liberalism needed tighter controls.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In Italy, differently, the problem to assess the health  care quality arises mainly for institutional (the reform of the national health  service) and economic reasons. The rationalization process required forms of measurement  and comparison of the costs of services in both public and private health care  organizations. The most popular approach to evaluate health care organizations  is based on the combination of outcome assessment with the evaluation of  patient satisfaction based on quality standards.</p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Approaches to  quality assessment</span></h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">There is a broad framework to analyse the quality of  health care in order to improve it. Referring to the Donabedian model, three  approaches to quality assessment can be identified, such as the <em>structure</em>, the <em>process</em> and the <em>result</em>.</p>
  <h1 style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">III.1 </span>Organizational  structure<span style="font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  term structure refers to &quot;the relatively stable characteristics of  administrators and health care workers, available tools and resources, and  organizational and physical environments in which they operate&quot;  (Donabedian, 1988). The concept of structure includes human, physical and  financial resources, necessary to health care. It refers to the number,  distribution and qualifications of professionals, equipment, and geographic location  of hospitals and other health services. It also includes both formal and  informal organizational methods to finance and deliver health services. The  organization of the medical and nursing staff, as weel as the quality assurance  project, are part of the concept of structure. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  use of the structure as indirect measure of the care quality depends on its  influence on the provided services. So the structure is linked to the quality  because it can increase or reduce the possibility of a satisfactory performance.  The relationship between the structure and the care quality is relevant for the  planning, design and implementation of systems for the delivery of health  services. A good structure, with adequate resources and the appropriate  programming system of services, is probably the most important instrument to  keep and promote quality. This is not surprising, because a good structure  includes a well-designed mechanism to monitor the quality of care and, on the  basis of the achieved results, operationally proceed. The utility of the  structure as indicator of quality of care is limited by the insufficient  knowledge of the relationship between structure and performance. A study in  nine intensive care units in the United States didn&rsquo;t find a correlation between  the quality assessed by the organizational audit and the quality of care  assessed by two results indicators: the ratio comparing actual and theoretical  mortality calculated for homogeneous group of patients, and the ratio comparing  actual and theoretical duration of stay (Zimmerman, Shortell et al., 1993).</p>
  <h1 style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">III.2 </span>Process  of care </h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  main object of evaluation is the care process, consisting of a series of  activities involving medical staff and patients. The process refers to a  sequence of actions or activities that transform inputs, provided by the  physicians, in output received by patients. In the case of a patient with a  fractured wrist that enters the emergency department of a hospital, the process  is what elapses between the request of health service (specifically  immobilizing the wrist) and the health service delivery. The health processes  are complex and often characterized by waste; so the quality can be improved  through the elimination of unnecessary activities in the execution of  processes. The improvement of the care processes requires that medical and  nursing staff work together to redesign processes. A study of Lord (1993)  describes the results of the redesign of the care plan after a surgical  hospitalization, that consist of the decrease of 50% of hospitalization and the  increase of the level of patient satisfaction.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  quality of the process can be assessed through the direct observation or the  examination of the recorded data to obtain the reconstruction of events. The  basis of the evaluation of quality is composed by the knowledge of the  relationship between the characteristics of the care process and their  consequences for the individual and social health and well-being. With  reference to the technical management, the relationship between the  characteristics of the care process and its consequences is theoretically  determined by the current state of medical and technology knowledge and by the  rules of good care. The set of rules governing the management of the  interpersonal relations derives, however, from the values &#8203;&#8203;of the  society, ethical principles and laws governing the relations between health  professionals and patients. So the quality of the care process is defined as a  normative behavior and the rules come from both medical science and ethical  principles and values (Donabedian, 1988).</p>
  <h1 style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">III.2 Outcome</span></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  study of the outcomes is the traditional approach to the evaluation of care  quality. The term outcome indicates a change in the status of current and  future health of the patient which can be attributed to a previous care,  including the improvement of both the social and psychological function and the  patient satisfaction. The result is used to denote the output of the technical  process, the benefit arising from the process, as assessed by the patient that  receives the output according to its expectations. The analysis of the benefits  requires the understanding and knowledge of customer needs and expectations.  The term customer is used to indicate the role that a person or unit has in the  time he receives the service. Health professionals are slowly accepting the  important difference between the patient requiring the care, and the customer  being attentive to quality and price. The competitive advantage can be based on  the manner in which an operator is effective to listen to customers and satisfy  their needs. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  orientation to customers needs and expectations is the heart of quality  management. Customers refers to both the patient and internal customer having  the dual role of producer and user in the production process; for example  pharmacy customers, departments of clinical documentation are clients of the  nursing unit. With regard to internal customers, in order to implement the  quality improvement program a system of relations has to be defined and  increased among departments according to effectiveness and efficiency  indicators.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  results evaluation, in health sector, is difficult to achieve; Australian Accreditation  Council estimates it takes four years to properly define an indicator of  clinical outcome. To assess the impact of the care quality on the results, it&rsquo;s  necessary to define specific indicators. Due to the complexity and diversity of  some typologies of patients, such as patients in intensive care, the proposed  indicators (mortality rates of nosocomial infections, the percentage of  unplanned readmissions within 24 or 48 hours, the frequency of iatrogenic  diseases) have to be carefully analyzed (Thijs, 1997). Their variations depend  on several factors and it&rsquo;s difficult to establish a direct link with the  quality of care. It should be considered all of the risk factors involved,  depending on differences of the type of patients, the severity of disease and  demographic conditions. Clinical practices have to be evaluated by indicators  regarding the consumption of resources, such as the length of the stay, the  efficiency and activity indicators, as well as clinical indicators based on the  evolution of the patient (De Simone, Servillo 1999).</p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">Quality and non  quality costs</span></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  aim of quality assessment programs is to reduce costs, as well as to improve  the quality and safety of care. The relationship between the quality and costs  can be formalized with the use of two concepts of industrial economics:  non-quality and quality costs. These concepts can allow the economic evaluation  of the impact of a quality program, useful for health care organizations to be  competitive on the market.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  costs of quality are often not measurable and not checked. The non-quality is  the sum of the consequences of the failures of the production process, that can  affect the final customer. In health-care, this concept can be applied to the  patient admission mode (not referring to the quality of diagnoses and  prescriptions), such as loss of time, redundancy procedures, unrespect of  hygiene, difficulty of access to information. The so-called system failures,  involving additional costs, include delays in health care, duplication of  investigations and treatments, lack of allignment to standard levels of  performance, loss of trust of the patients. Failures can occur during the  process of care before the patient receives them (<em>internal failures</em>) or be directly incurred by the patient (<em>external failures</em>) .</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  costs of operating failures, that can be in theory avoided, are unproductive,  and make the services not competitive and not accepted by patients, their  relatives and funding institutions. Efforts to make appropriate and correct  services from the beginning are minor compared with the repetition of the same  diagnostic procedures (eg x-rays). The definition of the quality value includes  documentation and periodic analysis of costs referring to the repetition of  tests and procedures for insufficient reliability and inadequate service.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  non-quality is a risk factor for the patient, the structure and the society.  The patient safety can be compromised by failure; the structure can have a  financial limitation for non-compliance with quality standards; the risk can be  social for the absences at work of the patient who suffers the consequences of  dysfunction. The necessary measures are often adopted after the check of the  consequences of non-quality while it would be better to adopt a prevention  policy.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Since  1970s in the United States, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health  Care Organizations has required to hospitals to implement programs of quality  assessment based on objective criteria. Hospitals have continued to gather the  information with the use of prevention criteria in order to avoid unexpected  events and improve quality (Sanazaro, Mills, 1991). Unexpected events are the  cause of the prolongation of hospitalization, readmissions, and even deaths  (Bates et al., 1995). Some criteria can allow identifying these events, such as  the unexpected transfer to the intensive care unit, a transfer surgery during  hospitalization, or additional surgery during the same hospital stay. These  indicators, however, are of limited value and often show partial results.  Indicators of outcome, structure or process must consider the whole functioning  of the organization (Hill et al., 1997). Unexpected events, in addition, don&rsquo;t  allow identifying relevant aspects of care quality, such as the appropriateness  of the diagnosis and the prescription. The identification of such events can be  a useful tool to raise awareness among health professionals on the risks of  clinical practice but it isn&rsquo;t a direct source of information on the quality or  lack of care quality, without the consideration of other elements.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  approach to the relationship between quality and costs with the use of the  concept of non quality cost is interesting for its immediate application to the  health sector, but it doesn&rsquo;t consider some aspects of quality such as  compliance and prevention. The cost of quality investment includes three  components as follows (Hill et al., 1997):</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">1. <em>Prevention costs</em> to minimize the cost of  failures and assessments (financial resources dedicated to quality management);</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">2. A<em>ssessment and compliance</em> <em>costs</em> to introduce clinical audit;</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">These  two types of costs are the cost of quality investing (table 1) .</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">3. <em>Failures costs and their corrections.</em> The costs of internal failures are associated with the correction procedures of  health care performance. These procedures require the use of additional resources.  The costs of external failures refer to legal disputes and the loss of image  towards customers. Sometimes it can be required repeated hospitalizations.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  cost of non-quality appears as a component of the cost of obtaining quality  (table 1).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">How  can it be applied to the health care field the cost of obtaining quality? In  the hospital, doctors and other health care professionals have the problem to  offer the service. The special feature of the hospital is that the patient  receives the service in real-time and the service can&rsquo;t be checked before the  delivery. That&rsquo;s why the quality control in the hospital must be based on the  prevention of errors through a system of training, information and  organization. The decrease of the failures, resulting from an increase in costs  of prevention, engenders the reduction of the cost to obtain the quality  (Waress, Pasternak, Smith, 1994).</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">Schneiderman  (1986) proposed to reconcile the approach of continuous quality improvement  with the notion of economic optimization and tried to demonstrate that an  increase in investment in prevention and compliance doesn&rsquo;t involve additional  costs or, if necessary, to show that these costs remain minimal.</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;text-indent:0in;"><span style="font-size:12.0pt; ">The impact of  quality programs</span></h1>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  introduction of quality programs in health care organizations can involve three  levels of change: cultural change, consisting in the active participation of  the members of the organization in the improvement process; a change in work  processes and way of working that means the preparation and dissemination of  the new protocol or procedure; and the improvement of the results that can be  observed in the duration of the two previous changes and the extent of the  effect of the improvement action (for example, the decrease of the rate of  nosocomial infections or the reduction of the number of falls of the old  patients in the hospital). </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  assessment of the impact of improvement action is critical to the success of quality  projects because it reward workers for their efforts. In the quality project,  the improvement of the results can be progressively achieved and sometimes lead  to a loss of motivation of the involved actors and it can be superficial  without the achievement of the first two levels of change. </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;">The  process of quality assessment needs the use of existing information and the  creation of the information systems in order to measure the economic impact of  this process (De Simone, Di Trapani, 2013). The implementation of the  assessment quality process can be difficult in hospitals, because there is coexistence  of the strong professional logic and administrative logic leading to the care  rationalization (De Simone, 2011).</p>
