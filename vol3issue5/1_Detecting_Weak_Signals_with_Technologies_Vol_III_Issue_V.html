Paper Title : <br>Detecting Weak Signals with Technologies<br>
Overview of current technology-enhanced approaches for the detection of weak signals 
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Research as well as enterprises are interested in detecting early signals for new developments and innovations. Therefore an increasing number of approaches to detect weak signals are developed and applied. Of course, technologies and applications also play a role within current signal detection research. Based on secondary sources, this contribution describes the results of a comparison of different technology-enhanced approaches for the detection of weak signals. We checked the literature concerning relevant case descriptions from 2009 to today. The analysis compares seven documented approaches including their utilization of technology in certain steps of the weak signals detection process. It can be shown that the current applications of technologies are very diverse. Case reports in the literature do not focus on reflecting about the technology use. In this paper, we fill this gap by offering a structured comparison as well as a comprehensive collection of reasons for or against either technology, including positive effects as well as challenges.</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Introduction </h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Computer systems play an important role in management  procedures. Of course, the use of computer systems influences and forms  management or at least some of its processes. Also within innovation management  and strategic considerations of business development for enterprises, computers  are involved. One approach of strategic development is the detection of  so-called &ldquo;weak signals&rdquo;. Such signals are seen as potential important signs  for future developments with big impact on the enterprise. Being able to  recognize such signals for future trends and developments early, might create  an opportunity to innovate products or services. The concept of &ldquo;weak signals&rdquo;  is thirty years old [1] and there is a wide variety of approaches to detect  them. Not surprisingly, also technologies are used to detect weak signals. Still,  the literature on weak signal detection offers no overview of how such technologies  are currently in use. Within this contribution, we will address this issue and start  with a short overview of the concrete research questions. Then the term &ldquo;weak  signals&rdquo; and technology use within foresight will be introduced. Building on  this, we will describe our research design to gain more insights about the use  of computers and Internet for the detection of weak signals for innovation purposes  as well as our research question. After the presentation of the results, we  will discuss and reflect our findings. </p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Detecting Weak Signals </h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">According to Ansoff weak signals are &ldquo;imprecise early  indications about impending impactful events&rdquo; [2]. All that is known, he  proceeds, &ldquo;is that some threats and opportunities will undoubtedly arise, but  their shape and nature and source are not yet known&rdquo; (ibid.). Compared with  other levels of knowledge about the future, weak signals are among the vaguest,  especially compared with &ldquo;drivers&rdquo; or even &ldquo;trends&rdquo; (see [1] and table 1). It is  either totally surprising (positively or negatively) or gives you the feeling  of change (ibid.).</p>

  <p class="MsoBodyText">The collection and detection of weak signals could &ldquo;be a  key to anticipating changes in advance and avoid letting them cause surprise&rdquo;  [3]. What makes the detection a big challenge is that they normally are hidden  in the &ldquo;noise of the daily produced data&rdquo; [4], see also figure 1. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In a survey experts should rank their favored sources for the  detection of weak signals [7]: In some of the branches, for example economics  as well as society and culture, futurologists are the preferred source for weak  signals detection. In politics, these are politicians; in technology and  science, these are scientists/ researchers. Besides individuals, who are always  at the first ranks of preferred sources, also other sources are amongst the top  ten, for example marginal/underground press (environment) or blogs (society and  culture).</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img width="330" height="173" src="1_Detecting_Weak_Signals_with_Technologies_Vol_III_Issue_V_image002.gif" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Text Box:  ">Nevertheless, it is unclear if weak signals  really (always) are present and detectable, even if the literature sometimes implies  &ldquo;that they lie &lsquo;out there&rsquo; almost as a commodity&rdquo; [8, p. 379]. To get a better  idea what characteristic &ldquo;weak signals&rdquo; might have or what they can be, it is  suggested to use hindsight to detect and identify weak signals for current  trends to get better information on how they might be detected in the future  [3]. Additionally, it is not only complicated to detect such weak signals in  the noise, but also to get them (or the &ldquo;real&rdquo; weak signals) into the further evaluation  process and discussion. Already Coffman described the issue of &ldquo;people who  &lsquo;know&rsquo;&rdquo; that scoffed at weak signals [5]. &ldquo;Cognitive filters&rdquo; influence the  final detection of what is coined as &ldquo;weak signals&rdquo; and which weak signals  might be overseen. Ansoff named mental filters that influence the realization  of weak signals within enterprises: The &ldquo;surveillance filter&rdquo; focuses on  special parts from the environment which might deliver data and the &ldquo;mentality  filter&rdquo; is responsible for the selection that comes to perception in a firm.  The third filter, the &ldquo;power filter&rdquo; might be the influence of managers who neglect  information. As described and empirically shown in [9], such mental filters can  be influenced by the setting. Filters can be opened by &ldquo;virtual process, open  question and anonymity&rdquo; (ibid., p. 919). The filters can be deepened through  &ldquo;focused scope, close to the current strategy, strong requirement for  plausibility and probability in the social interaction process&rdquo; and others (ibid.,  p. 919).</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Besides these challenges, weak signals detection draws  increasing attention from futurologists as well as enterprises, because this  concept gives at least a framework of how future developments might be  recognized in a very early stage. Concrete approaches and applications are part  of strategic foresight activities in enterprises as well as in research, and  are still under development. Of course, technologies play a growing role within  such approaches.</p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Use of technologies for foresight</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">IT tools are more and more used to detect weak signals. This  is especially illustrated with a comparison of about 20 social media monitoring  tools according to their usability for the detection of weak signals [4]. Main  criteria are: clear and versatile presentation of the results, support of  directed and undirected search, variety of analyses, multilingual analyses, and  time series analyses. These criteria are related to functionalities of the  software, however social media monitoring software is not the only way to  detect weak signals. So, it stills remains unclear, in which ways technologies,  for example IT tools or systems, are currently in use for the detection of weak  signals.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText"><img width="328" height="40" src="1_Detecting_Weak_Signals_with_Technologies_Vol_III_Issue_V_image003.gif" align="left" hspace="12" alt="Text Box: Figure 2. Evolution of a weak signal,   building upon Coffman [5] and Steinmüller [6]    ">Rohrbeck et al. provide a more general  overview of use of IT tools for foresight within enterprises ([10], see table  2). They distinguish between tools that are used for data gathering, for  interpretation, and for organizational response. Rohrbeck himself describes his  overview as &ldquo;only a limited understanding about how individual IT support tools  can be integrated into holistic foresight support systems&rdquo; and refers to [11]. For  example, social media monitoring or data-mining tools are missing in Rohrbeck&rsquo;s  overview.</p>

  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Research Questions</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">There are many hints for approaches to detect weak signals  for innovation purposes in the literature. Technology-enhanced detection  methods or analyses seem to be quite common. Nevertheless, the concrete use of  tools seems to be diverse and often also vague. In our research, we try to find  answers to the following questions concerning the last five years:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How are weak signals detected with  technology-enhanced systems and methodologies?</li>
    <li>In which concrete ways and roles are  technologies currently in use for the detection of weak signals?</li>
    <li>How does technology influence the detection of weak  signals?</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Research Design</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Combining literature research and analysis, we try to  address the above research questions. </p>
  <h2>Collection  and Selection of Examples</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">For the detection of examples, we undertook a comprehensive  literature search. We hereby focused primarily on research papers in order to  gain a more elaborated and concrete description of uses and applications than possible  using other sources. Therefore, we scanned all publications of the last five years  described in the database Sciencedirect.com. We searched for the terms &ldquo;weak  signal&rdquo;, &ldquo;detection&rdquo; and &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; beginning with the year 2009. In addition,  we used Google Scholar and followed the references within literature to find  possible publications that could not be found with the above method.&nbsp; </p>
  <h2>Criteria  to describe detection approaches in the literature</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Possibilities to describe diverse approaches to detect  weak signals are to be found in the literature. For example, approaches to  detect weak signals are already compared on a very general level based on the  following aspects [13; p. 20]: information/insight quality, continuity of  analysis, efficiency, real-time information, information amount, and  quantitative overview. Another contribution lists functionalities of social  media monitoring tools that might be used to detect weak signals, e.g. clear  and versatile presentation of the results [4]. As we are less interested in  concrete analysis tools, but in the general use of technologies within the  process of weak signal detection, we are developing a scheme to compare the  roles of technologies.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">For this purpose, we discussed several approaches to  analyze the use of tools. Finally, we decided for a simple process-orientated  approach. Therefore, we divided the weak signals detection process into five steps  and looked how technology is used within each part: (i) Selection of sources  and data collection, (ii) data processing and analysis, (iii) evaluation and  discussion, (iv) presentation and communication, and finally (v) action. </p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Results</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In the following, we present the results of our literature  analysis concerning the use of computer support and systems for weak signals  detection. </p>
  <h2>Selected  cases with descriptions of technology-enhanced weak signals detection</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Within Sciencedirect, we reached 626 hits (September 2014)  for the search terms &ldquo;weak signals&rdquo;, &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; and &ldquo;detection&rdquo;. A majority of  these hits was not from future studies, but from physics, e.g. about amateur  radio weak-signal communication. After scanning all abstracts, we selected 14  publications, where the abstract gave the impression of a detailed description  of the concrete approach and the technology used. After reading them, only five  publications remained offering valuable insights into concrete cases [10,14,15,16,17].  Other papers were not included in this selection, because the concrete use of  IT and the general approach were not described. For example [18] discusses  uncertainty factors for a Norwegian high-speed railway project as weak signals detection  analysis, but includes no description of technology use, although it seems very  clear that some kind of technology was used. Other papers on the topic only  describe the use of technologies but give no concrete case insights, for example  [19]. Other articles are hindsight analyses without adoption of the developed  or tested approaches within current settings [20,21]. In some cases, two or  more papers were available for the same or similar cases or experiences, see  [13,22]. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Using Google Scholar and following the references of the  found publications, further (potential) case descriptions were found. Again,  some of the papers did not describe how (and if) technologies were concretely  used within their weak signals detection process, while it seems obvious that  they used software, for example while detecting weak signals within technology-enhanced  learning [23]. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, also older contributions (before 2009) are  available that describe the use of IT for weak signals detection, for example  [9, 19]. As our final set of current contributions is small, we discussed to  integrate them. However, very similar approaches and experiences were found in  our set of current papers and due to the fast development of IT technologies, we  did not extent our search horizon (e.g. including only papers from the last  five years). </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">To sum up, we collected a set of seven research papers  that specify the use of technology for weak signals detection. Our final set of  publications describes the following uses of IT within the process of weak  signals detection:</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(a) A naive application of text mining to  identify emerging terms within conference abstracts in the field of technology-enhanced  learning [24].</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(b) A tool set for scouting (collecting data  from scouts, edited by an expert round) as part of an integrated insight and  response system at the Deutsche Telekom Innovation Laboratories [10]</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(c) The application of a quantitative model for  detecting weak signals (emerging trends) with the help of a inference model and  Bayesian network at a &ldquo;weak signals tracking board&rdquo; as part of the &ldquo;New and  Emerging Signals of Trends&rdquo; model dealing with future sciences and technologies  [14]</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(d) In the field of life sciences a set of  monitoring and data-mining approaches are integrated to deliver a &ldquo;technology  radar&rdquo; with the help of a technology watch team [15]. </p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(e) The &ldquo;Innovation signals&rdquo; approach combines  automatic (semantic data mining technology) and social scientific analyses of  user-generated content to detect weak signals within the topic alpine skiing  [13,22]</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(f)  In another case study, weak signals in the field of on-site medical oxygen  production were detected with semantic web mining and latent semantic indexing.  The authors additionally compare the results (the labelling of the diverse  sources) with manual work and calculate precision and recall. [16]</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">(g)  In the last case a text mining approach is described, where Web news are analysed  through keyword search related to solar cells. Signals  that got recently stronger and are relatively seldom are seen as potential weak  signals. [17]</p>

Forms of technologies in use for weak signals detection   within the current literature  ">Overview of approaches of weak  signals detection with technologies</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">First of all, we wanted to know which approaches of weak  signals detection are deployed when technologies are in use. We found the  following approaches within our set of current approaches:</p>
  <p class="bulletlist" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Within four approaches, IT tools are integrated in  a complex and combined automatic as well as expert-based detection of weak  signals and other future developments (c,d,e,g).</p>
  <p class="bulletlist" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Within two approaches, description technology is  used for a semi-automatic mining (analysis) strategy (a,f).</p>
  <p class="bulletlist" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Within one approach, description tools are used  to support the community-based collection and detection of weak signals (b).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">According to our process-oriented analysis, the application  of technologies can be outlined as depicted in fig. 2. As it is shown, none of  the described applications are built completely on the use of technologies and delivered  automatically only. Additionally, it can be seen that IT tools are used within  every process step to a certain amount. It seems safe to assume that information  technologies play a bigger role in the process, as IT tools are standard for  communication as well as research. We guess that several more &ldquo;standard&rdquo; tools  (for presentation, storage, processing) may be used but not described within a  scientific contribution. Thus, our description here only includes those technologies  that specifically refer to weak signal detection.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In the following, we will describe the use of technologies  along the process of weak signal detection. Please be aware that this description  mixes (snippets of) several distinct approaches.</p>
  <h2>Technology  use for selection of sources and data collection </h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Technologies are in use for the selection of sources and  data collection. Within the Innovation Signals approach (e) [13,22] search  engines are used to collect and define valuable community systems as sources  for later analysis. At Deutsche Telekom (DT) Group (b) [10] three integrated  platforms support foresight and response systems. The detection of weak signals  is only addressed in the phase where a scouting tool is in use (PEACOQ  Scouting). Internal and external scouts contribute their findings within the  system; editors filter their contributions. Interestingly, within case (c)  personal opinions (even on source data) are not allowed [14, p.72], only  quality checks of an existing collection are possible. Whereas in case (f) the  search queries building on a hypothesis are created manually, also the  selection of keywords in other languages and the next steps of web mining are  processed automatically: Search engines are used and crawlers extract full  texts from all URLs. Surprisingly, although Web news are sources in case (g),  the data was not extracted from the Web as a data base was used (with Web news,  publications and more), so that no additional source selection is needed. </p>
  <h2>Technology  use for data processing and analysis</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In five cases (a,d,e,f,g), technologies are used for data  analysis, but three of them (d,e,f) use additional social scientific techniques  in the analytic phase. In two cases (a,g), text mining approaches try to  identify and count developments of topics, minimizing human effort. Within the  cases d and e the concrete analysis is not described, but both cases refer to  semantic analysis and additional expert evaluations and decisions made while  analyzing. The innovation signals approach (e) for example uses bottom-up as  well as top-down approaches when trying to find a deeper understanding of potential  weak signals. That means pre-defined keywords (top-down) are used for analysis as  well as data mining approaches (bottom-up) &ndash; and the analysis itself is not only  done with the support of a tool, but essentially builds on social sciences&rsquo;  competencies. Within case (f) the (automatically) retrieved documents are  analyzed within certain steps (and tools): cleaning of raw data, filtering  (e.g. word stemming). Then longer texts were broken down into smaller segments (sentences,  via tokenization). As latent semantic analysis requires all texts to be in the  same language, everything was automatically translated into English beforehand.</p>
  <h2>Technology  use for evaluation and discussion</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In case (b), where weak signals were collected with the  help of scouts, the process of evaluation is also supported through the system.  Editors for example reject new &ldquo;topics&rdquo;, combine them and put them in order. In  an expert round, the topics are assessed and a short-list is selected with  topics (weak signals) that have to be investigated in more depth. In case (c),  the key support of technologies can be seen within the evaluation process. Data  of experts are the base for an analysis as inference model, using a Bayesian  network, calculating several probabilities for certain developments. This is  illustrated at a &ldquo;weak signals tracking board&rdquo; and part of a more complex &ldquo;New  and Emerging Signals of Trends&rdquo; model dealing with future sciences and  technologies (and not only with weak signals) [14]. Within case (g) the  decision which signals are weak or strong and which are seen as &ldquo;weak signals&rdquo; are  based on the two dimensions frequency and time, weighted by the rate of  increase. Within case (f), where the process was dominated by automatic  analysis, the evaluation phase includes a test of results quality. Therefore,  the latent analysis part was also manually done and recall and precision were  calculated by hand. This gives an idea of how precise the approach is at this  certain step. </p>
  <h2>Technology  use for presentation and communication</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In case (b) the PEACOQ Scouting tool is related to the  other tools and systems. Content can be shared within the whole Telekom group  for example at the Intranet landing page. Within all other cases no special  support through technologies is mentioned.</p>
  <h2>Reasons  for the use of technology </h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">With one exception (b), the cases in the literature do not  discuss the role of IT use itself,. So, the following reasons for the use of technology  are dominated by this case.</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">In general, within the cases (a,c,d,e,f,g) it  would not be possible to deal with the amount of data and to carry out the  analysis manually. This would probably be impossible without the help of  technologies. In case (c), the tool helps to analyze complex data  (probabilities for single events) in a comprehensive way (probabilities that  certain signals will have an influence in the future). Within case (e), the use  of tools for analysis of user-generated content aims to find new ideas for and  insights into possibly interesting topics or signals through automated analysis  by means of semantically enhanced data mining (e). </p>
  <p class="bulletlist">Within case (b), the use of a platform is  essential so that all Deutsche Telekom employees and also external stakeholder  can contribute, because face-to-face meetings or other solutions would be more  expensive or unapt.</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">In case (b), the mobile application for the  scouting system gives the opportunity to contribute small &ldquo;surprises&rdquo; and  reflections to the system in a relatively simple and informal way. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:0in;">While using the technologies in  the process of weak signals detection, the literature also offers some insights  into positive effects and challenges.</p>
  <h2>Positive  effects of the use of technology </h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The following positive effects might result from the use  of technology in our seven cases:</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">The scouting system makes it possible that  internal and external scouts from different countries can contribute. (b)</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">The integration of the weak signal detection  platform (scouting platform) with other systems makes it possible to integrate  the weak signals into other strategic processes around future developments  (e.g. idea generation). (b)</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">The development of mobile views triggered an  increase in contributions. Concerning &bdquo;detecting change&ldquo;: &bdquo;The Scouting Tool  allows posting reports on change when they are still in the stage of a weak  signal, as the transaction cost associated with posting topics is comparatively  low.&rdquo; [10] (b) </p>
  <h2>Challenges of the use of technology </h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The following challenges of the application of technologies  are addressed within the case descriptions: </p>
  <p class="bulletlist" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Within case (a), several special challenges in text  mining are addressed, that are not directly a consequence of the use of technology,  e.g. the appearance of project acronyms as possible false-positive term  identification [10, p. 53].</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">Case (b) reports &bdquo;effects such as the reduction  of face-to-face communication that might reduce the overall level of  interaction and potentially the level of trust&ldquo;; but they continue to have  face-to-face occasions [10].</p>
  <p class="bulletlist">Another challenge within case (b) was that a lot  of people should use the platform as &bdquo;yet another tool&ldquo; - single-sign-on improved  this. </p>
  <p class="bulletlist" style="margin-bottom:.0001pt;">Internally, the Deutsche Telekom reports of  security issues within case (b), which are a challenge every enterprise-wide  system faces.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Besides the description of (b), a detailed description  of arguments pro and contra the use of technology is not available, by now. Our  collection here should be seen as a first, albeit incomplete, collection.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The influence of technology on weak signals  detection</h2>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">On a meta-level, we want to reflect on the influence of  technology on the practice of weak signals detection in addition to obvious and  listed reasons, positive effects and challenges. As we did not find an approach  towards weak signals detection without technology support, this is of course a somewhat  speculative approach. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Taking the above set of cases as potentially  representative for current weak signals detection with technologies in general,  the current use of technology seems to be very diverse. Case (b) builds on a  support of collection and communication as well as evaluation. Here, the main  idea is to develop an appropriate infrastructure to support individual scouts,  including a mobile application. This is directly related to the preferred  source of data within the case: contributions of internal and external scouts.  Within all other settings, the technology supports the analysis of data, either  in the first phase of analysis (a,d,e,f,g) or in the evaluation phase (b,c,g).  In four cases (d,c,e,g) this includes experts decisions and additional analyses.  Only within two cases (e,g) content from the Web was used as a source for weak  signals detection, for example Weblogs [19].</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Interestingly, arguments building on the filter theory  that IT communication systems allow anonymous contributions and reduce effects  of some filters [9], are not mentioned within case (b) and do not seem to have  consequences in the other cases.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Currently, a Delphi study with a global panel of foresight  experts on the influence of information and communication technologies on  future foresight processes was published [25]. In general, the Delphi study  demonstrates that ICT in 2020 will be a &ldquo;driver for certain parts of the  foresight process: As a result, foresight will become more result and  interpretation orientated&rdquo;. According to many experts, human intuition &ldquo;will  still be the deciding factor in decision making in 2020&rdquo;. Therefore it might be  interesting, how this view influences future use of technologies in the  detection of weak signals. </p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Discussion</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, we want to critically discuss our research design  as well as the results and futures issues. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">According to our literature research, we used the complete  relevant set of papers from one database. Additionally, we used other  literature databases and references to find additional contributions. But although  our approach of literature research was systematic our set is still small, and we  are not able to claim that our sample is complete. Of course, there might be  other current contributions that describe the use of IT within a weak signals  detection process. Yet from our point of view, we would be surprised if  additional contributions described completely different settings compared to  what we found in our selection of papers.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In addition, our research is limited to approaches that  are documented within the literature. Authors of the analyzed contributions did  not intend to generate such figures, but we aimed to clarify and sort diverse  settings and possibilities that are currently in use. Therefore we consider the  delivered overview as a good starting point for future surveys among  practitioners and experts, to get reliable data on the exact amount and forms  of computer use and its lessons learned.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Finally, our focus on IT in the detection of weak signals  should not conceal that it is neither essential, nor completely common to use  software support for the detection of weak signals, nor that it is central. For  example, there are also qualitative approaches in use that try to detect  evolving patterns instead of single signal or path extrapolation approaches.  These approaches probably also require the use of computers, but not for  analytical reasons [1].</p>
