Paper Title :<br>Structural European Funds related to Romania in the period 2014-2020 and convergence to the European Union
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Through this article we aim to present the importance of structural and cohesion funds in Romania, for the financial period 2014-2020 and the convergence to the European Union of our country. The experience that our country has from 2007 to 2013, can further highlight the importance of effective coordination and a strategic vision in promoting and attracting financial capital from the European Union. European funds aim to develop certain areas and support Member States in order to be able to reach certain development standards, in order to eliminate as much as possible, the discrepancies between them. The Structural Funds are non-reimbursable, i.e. no interest is charged on their granting and the money received from the European Union (EU or the Union), through specific programs, must not be repaid. However, receiving these funds involves making certain investments that should lead to an increase in gross value added in the fields of application. The importance of public policies, which aim to streamline the activities carried out within government institutions, will have a particularly important role in ensuring the efficiency of the degree of absorption and implementation of structural funds. These will be quantified using performance indicators and results forecasted and assumed both centrally and locally. We will also highlight the main strategic objectives and investment priorities of Romania, in line with the European ones for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</p>

  <p><em>Abstract </em>&mdash; Through this article we aim to  present the importance of structural and cohesion funds in Romania, for the  financial period 2014-2020 and the convergence to the European Union of our  country. The experience that our country has from 2007 to 2013, can further  highlight the importance of effective coordination and a strategic vision in  promoting and attracting financial capital from the European Union. European  funds aim to develop certain areas and support Member States in order to be  able to reach certain development standards, in order to eliminate as much as  possible, the discrepancies between them. The Structural Funds are  non-reimbursable, i.e. no interest is charged on their granting and the money  received from the European Union (EU or the Union), through specific programs,  must not be repaid. However, receiving these funds involves making certain  investments that should lead to an increase in gross value added in the fields  of application. The importance of public policies, which aim to streamline the  activities carried out within government institutions, will have a particularly  important role in ensuring the efficiency of the degree of absorption and  implementation of structural funds. These will be quantified using performance  indicators and results forecasted and assumed both centrally and locally. We  will also highlight the main strategic objectives and investment priorities of  Romania, in line with the European ones for a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.<br>
    <strong><em>Keywords-</em></strong><strong><em>Economic:  policies, competitiveness, sustainable development, cohesion.</em></strong></p>
  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>The Structural Funds contribute to  a lasting balance at European Union level by strengthening competitiveness,  developing disadvantaged areas, supporting people from disadvantaged groups,  supporting young people, promoting initiatives, protecting the environment,  reintegrating and converting, and investing in infrastructure.<br>
    For Romania, European funds will  continue to be one of the most important tools to be used to reduce regional  disparities, as well as promoting economic growth at regional and local level,  strengthening competitiveness and increasing employment, benchmarks at European  Union, [1], level. <br>
    It is recognized that the  achievement of these objectives is possible by ensuring a favorable environment  for investment, the establishment of new companies or the development of  existing ones, contributing significantly to the creation of new jobs and the  generation of added value [2], [3].<br>
    In this context, the use of  structural support for the period 2014-2020 aims to create the conditions for  constant improvement and development of the business environment, having as  main objectives:<br>
    &bull; stimulating the competitiveness  of enterprises;<br>
    &bull; facilitating access to finance;<br>
    &bull; creating a favorable environment  for creating new businesses and encouraging the entrepreneurial culture;<br>
    &bull; supporting companies to operate  externally and access new markets;<br>
    &bull; ensuring a qualified and  adaptable workforce.<br>
    Measures in this challenge will  focus on the following thematic areas:<br>
    &bull; research, technological  development and innovation. The proposed interventions are aimed at supporting  innovation in enterprises, as well as by building capacities for excellence in  research and innovation and for technological change. In rural areas,  innovation and the knowledge base will be strengthened through cooperation  between the agricultural, food and forestry sectors and other actors, as well  as through the creation of clusters and networks and the use of consultancy  services.<br>
    &bull;  information and communication technology. Increasing the  capacity of companies or entrepreneurs to have access to services, as well as  increasing their use.<br>
    &bull; the competitiveness of SMEs -  Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, the agricultural sector and the fisheries  and aquaculture sector. Efforts will be focused on supporting investment in  entrepreneurship, commercial exploitation of new ideas and research results, by  providing business advisory services, and supporting the development of online  tools.<br>
    Interventions to improve the  competitiveness of the agricultural sector will help ensure sustainable food  production in the EU and contribute to job creation and preservation, as well  as economic growth in rural areas.<br>
    For the period 2014&ndash;2020, member  countries are required to develop and implement strategic plans for accessing  ESI funds. The process has been simplified and streamlined by creating, at  European level, a common strategic framework included in the partnership agreement  and a unified definition of common standards for member countries' programs [7].  Romania is currently developing and implementing functional strategic planning  and monitoring tools to be able to see where there is an urgent need to attract  European non-reimbursable funds.<br>
    There is a need for information,  transparency and support, for all those interested, from entrepreneurs to  farmers, to gather the necessary information and receive guidance, not to find  it extremely complicated to submit projects with European grants.<br>
    Everyone needs to be advised and  guided so that they know where to start, without encountering problems along  the way, and their projects go all the way from the &quot;sketch on paper&quot;  stage to the moment of non-reimbursement of funds in a cursive way, without  encountering too many bureaucratic or other problems [4].<br>
    At EU level, the ESI Funds have  been continuously reformed, including for 2014&ndash;2020, in order to maximize the  contributions leading to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy  measures. This aims at three (3) socio-economic objectives, as can be seen in  the figure below [7], [8]:</p>

    Fig. 1- Europe 2020 Strategy<br>
    The specific regulation for the  allocation of these grants sets out in detail how they can contribute to the  achievement of thematic objectives through investment or other EU priorities.<br>
    Regarding the current situation of  Romania, the absorption of European non-reimbursable funds is according to our  country's partnership agreement with the E.C..</p>
  <h1>Romania's  convergence with the European Union strategy</h1>
  <p>The economic and financial crisis  highlights the need to improve reforms at European level and speed up the  process of implementing reforms at Member State level, in order to promote  increased employment at Union level, as well as the coordination of national  policies. member with the policies of the European Commission.<br>
    The  Europe 2020 strategy, which is based on the premise of sustainable, smart and  inclusive growth, has been successfully implemented over time through the  implementation of European programs by Member States. <br>
    The Europe 2020 strategy is a  ten-year strategy by which the European Union aims to support growth and jobs,  launched in 2010.<br>
    The strategy aims to eliminate the  shortcomings of our development model and create favorable conditions for  smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Member  States' economies are growing and developing gradually, and the aim of this  strategy is to overcome the obstacles posed by possible crises.<br>
    To achieve this by the end of 2020,  the EU has set five key targets for employment, research and development,  energy / climate, education, social inclusion and poverty reduction.<br>
    The five European targets for 2020  are [8], [9]:<br>
    1. Employment - an employment rate  of 75% among the population aged 20 to 64<br>
    2. Research and development -  allocating 3% of EU GDP to research and development<br>
    3. Climate change and sustainable  energy use:<br>
    -20% reduction in greenhouse gas  emissions (or even 30%, under favorable conditions) compared to 1990 levels <br>
    -increase the share of renewable  energy sources up to 20%<br>
    -20% increase in energy efficiency<br>
    4. Education:<br>
    - reducing the rate of early school  leaving below 10%<br>
    - increase to over 40% of the share  of higher education graduates among the population aged 30-34<br>
    5. Combating  poverty and social exclusion - the reduction of the number of people suffering  from poverty by at least 20 million is considered and their social inclusion is  considered.<br>
    The EU has identified new areas  that could boost growth and create new jobs. They are at the heart of 7 major  initiatives.<br>
    Within each initiative, European  and national authorities must coordinate their efforts to support each other.  Most of the initiatives were presented by the Commission in 2010.<br>
    - Smart and sustainable growth - involves the  development of innovation within the European Union, along with better mobility  of young people;<br>
    -Sustainable growth: A  resource-efficient Europe; An industrial policy for the era of globalization<br>
    - Inclusive growth: An agenda for  new skills and new jobs, A European platform for combating poverty<br>
    The new EU economic governance is  based on three pillars:<br>
    1. Strengthening the economic  agenda through closer surveillance by the EU. This pillar includes: the  political priorities and objectives set out in the Europe 2020 Strategy, the  additional commitments made by the Member States participating in the Euro Pact  plus, the strengthening of EU surveillance of economic and fiscal policies as  part of the Stability Pact, and growth, but also through new instruments  designed to stop macroeconomic imbalances, the adoption of a new working method  - the European Semester - highlighting  the economic and budget execution priorities, being done annually. <br>
    2. Ensuring  the permanent stability of the euro area. Since 2010, the European Commission  has supported Member States through cooperation mechanisms, as well as through  temporary support for national policies. These temporary mechanisms have been  replaced by permanent mechanisms, integrated into the European Stability  Mechanism (ESM). This mechanism has imposed conditionalities. Among these  conditionalities we mention the most important of these, namely: the  implementation of European programs, financial reform and consolidation, as  well as close collaboration with the IMF.<br>
    3. Recovery of the financial  sector, other actions are currently being taken, in particular to ensure that  European banks have sufficient capital reserves to deal with future shocks to  the financial system and to continue to operate and provide credit to  businesses. and individuals.<br>
    In practice, the Union has set five  major objectives to be met by 2020, and Member States, including Romania, have  adopted their own national objectives in these areas, the various actions at  European and national level support the Strategy.<br>
    During the absorption period,  Romania must meet the following indicators:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>employment  rate of the population aged 20-64 to be higher than 70%;</li>
    <li>investments  in research and development 2% of GDP;</li>
    <li>energy  and climate change: 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990; <a name="_Hlk44939018">Increasing the share of electricity consumption from  renewable sources, up to a gross level of 24%; Increasing the efficiency of  energy consumption, by reducing by up to 19% of the average gross consumption  level.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>school  education: an early school leaving rate below 11.3%; a rate of the population  aged 30-34 graduating from a form of tertiary education 26.7%</li>
    <li>promoting  social inclusion, especially by reducing poverty - reducing the number of  people at risk of poverty and social exclusion - by at least 580,000 people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Romania's value targets for meeting  the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy were set following debates by the  Romanian authorities and then approved by the European Commission. These  indicators were included in the National Reform Program of Romania.</p>
  <h1>National legislation and rules applicable to the  management, coordination, and implementation of European funds</h1>
  <p>The implementation system of the  structural funds is much more efficient in the period 2014 - 2020, due to the  simplification of the institutional structure, compared to the period 2007 -  2013. At the same time, the management of the operational programs will be  better coordinated, being established roles and attributions at the level of  the managing authority:<br>
    &bull; The Ministry of European Funds is  coordinating: The Large Infrastructure Operational Program together with the  Human Capital Operational Program and the Competitiveness Operational Program. The  Ministry of European Funds is also involved in coordinating the Technical  Assistance Operational Program and the Disadvantaged Aid Operational Program.<br>
    &bull; The Regional Operational Program,  the Operational Program Administrative Capacity is in a direct coordination of  the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration. &nbsp;This Ministry will be the managing authority;<br>
    &bull; The Ministry of Agriculture and  Rural Development will be the managing authority for the National Program for  Rural Development, respectively the Operational Program for Fisheries.<br>
    The coordination of operational  programs will consider the lessons learned and aims to streamline the  implementation process and reduce the administrative burden, and the thematic  concentration of funds will ensure a significant impact of investments, leading  to a continuity of sustainable interventions in their areas of intervention.<br>
    The changes to the framework for  the implementation of the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESFS),  which aimed to simplify funding programs and procedures, were respected. The  European Commission's commitment to the new financial perspective has been to  facilitate access to European funds, thus encouraging more beneficiaries to  prepare projects for the use of these resources, as well as to improve the  mechanisms for implementing regional policies at EU level. and ensure the  optimal level of control.<br>
    For the period 2014-2020, common  rules have been developed applicable to the cohesion policy of rural  development policy, as well as to the maritime business and fisheries policy.  The European Commission has established a Regulation on common provisions,  setting out a set of principles applicable to all funds in the common strategic  framework - European Regional Development Fund (E.R.D.F.), European Social Fund  (E.S.F.), Cohesion Fund (C.F.), European Agricultural Fund for Rural  Development (E.A.F.R.D.), European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (E.M.F.F.) - as  regards strategic planning, programming and sustainable development, with the ultimate  goal of stimulate economic growth and job creation.<br>
    The rules for the period 2014-2020  introduce new options in order to ensure greater flexibility in setting  national and regional measures. Thus, in Romania, for the period 2014-2020, a  concentrated/ centralized structure is envisaged, at the level of three  ministries, regarding the management of European Investment Funds.<br>
    In order to ensure the  concentration of investment at EU level for certain priorities, minimum  allocations by categories of regions are set. For example, less developed  regions need to have a wider range of investment priorities, however they will  have to allocate at least 50% of ERDF resources for increasing energy  efficiency, as well as increasing the share of renewable energy. Supporting  SMEs and supporting innovation are also funded priorities.<br>
    The remaining resources will be  directed to the most appropriate interventions to meet the needs of those  areas.<br>
    One of the most important changes  concerns eligibility and simplification of financial management. For the period  2014-2020, the European Commission aims to maintain and promote a wider use of  cost simplification options, as an alternative to reimbursement based on real  costs.<br>
    Using these options benefits both  the programs and the beneficiaries. On the one hand, it speeds up payments, on  the other hand it will allow beneficiaries to focus on project implementation  by limiting financial reporting requirements, reimbursement based on flat rates  and unit cost standards or even replacing it by reporting the level of  realization of indicators, in case of using the reimbursement based on lump  sums [5].<br>
    Examining the progress and  performance of interventions has always been a challenge at EU level.  Establishing a performance framework at the level of operational programs is  one of the tools through which FESI's results orientation can be achieved. The  establishment of the degree of performance consists of fulfilling the  obligations assumed within each priority axis of the European Union, as well as  by fulfilling the assumed financial indicators. <br>
    MySMIS, a related application of  the current Single Information Management System (SMIS), will respond to the  general principles regarding the exchange of information between authorities  and beneficiaries. In the case of the European Territorial Cooperation  Objective, given the specificity of the programs carried out under this  objective, it was agreed that the MIS-CTE application be used and developed  separately from MySMIS, under the responsibility of MRDPA. Programs funded by  the EAFRD and the EMFF do not have to comply with e-Cohesion requirements.</p>
  <p>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; European founds and investment program funds related to Romania</p>
  <p>In order to meet the objectives,  Romania has been allocated, for the period 2014&ndash;2020, funds of approximately  22.4 billion Euros (ERDF, ESF, CF funds), plus 106 million Euros for the  development of new jobs for young people, for the agricultural sector and rural  areas will add EUR 8 billion to the EAFRD, for a total of around EUR 168 million  [7].<br>
    Calculating, Romania, through the  nine programs, benefits, on average, from a financing per capita of 1,548 Euro,  for the period 2014&ndash;2020, which should translate into economic growth, if most  of the funds were attracted. In order to avoid repeating mistakes, the previous  financial year 2007-2013 should be very well analyzed and concluded where and  why it was wrong. In the previous financial year, out of the 4.4 billion euros  not accessed from the EU budget, more than a third, i.e. 1.64 billion euros,  belonged to Romania [7]. <br>
    In the period 2014&ndash;2020, Romania  has allocated the amounts stated above from EU funds through the operational  programs listed below [8]:<br>
    &bull; Regional Operational Program<br>
    &bull; Competitiveness Operational  Program<br>

    &bull; National Program for Rural  Development<br>
    &bull; Fisheries Operational Program<br>
    &bull; Connecting Europe Facility<br>
    &bull; Territorial cooperation programs<br>
    EU countries manage the funds in a  decentralized way, through shared management. The sites dedicated to these  funds provide additional information on the funding available and the  application procedure.<br>
    We can highlight the main  operational programs and the priorities proposed for funding in the next  period:<br>
    &#61656; Large Infrastructure  Operational Program<br>
    The budget allocated to Romania for  the period 2014-2020 is 9.07 billion euros, of which 2.48 billion ERDF and 6.59  billion Cohesion Fund.<br>

  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>European policy has a common vision  for the economic cohesion of the Member States. This vision includes not only  the economic development of the lagging regions, but also the support of  vulnerable social groups.<br>
    The social and ecological  sustainability of development and respect for the territorial and cultural  characteristics of the various parts of the European Union is also a continuing  concern.<br>
    This vision is reflected in  everything that means the variety of funds, programs, areas of intervention and  partners.<br>
    The European Union's policies and  programs train around 10 million people a year, with a strong focus on young  people, the long-term unemployed and the low-skilled.<br>
    Through these local development  initiatives, European cohesion and integration policy has an impressive history  of cross-border cooperation, the regeneration of impoverished urban  neighborhoods and the contribution to access to services in rural areas. The  involvement of regional and local communities is the key to improving policies  in the future.<br>
    The evaluations clearly showed that  the active participation of people and organizations in the field at regional  and local level, from the planning stage to implementation, is a key factor in  the functioning of development initiatives.<br>
    Such a partnership is a major  source of added value for cohesion policy, mobilizing skills and knowledge to  streamline and make programs more inclusive.<br>
    A repeated result of the evaluation  in all areas of investment highlighted the concern, in Romania, on increasing  the degree of absorption, ie on spending funds, rather than focusing on the  objectives for which these programs were created. The first concern is  obviously the precondition for success, but the second is of real importance  through the efficiency of sustainable economic development.<br>
    Cohesion policy in Romania must  promote a performance orientation, which must start from focusing on programs  that identify only a limited number of policy priorities, being a key  factor in the functioning and development of the initiatives undertaken through  projects.<br>
    &nbsp;The way in which their realization will  contribute to the economic, social and territorial development of the regions  or Member States involved, contributes to the development of the European Union  as a whole.</p>
