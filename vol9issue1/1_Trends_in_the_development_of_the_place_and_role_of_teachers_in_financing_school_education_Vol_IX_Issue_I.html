<p><strong>Annotation: </strong>The article analyzes the current state of financing  of school education in Uzbekistan. Teachers' attitudes towards the funding  process were determined through a questionnaire and the results were analyzed.  According to him, the advantages and disadvantages of remuneration of labor,  the relationship between the factors determining the quality of education and  funding are studied. Scientific proposals and conclusions are formed on the  basis of research.<br>
  <strong>Keywords: </strong>school education, funding, remuneration, quality of  education, human capital</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  At  the 70th Summit of the United Nations Organization in September 2015,  Sustainable Development Goals were adopted. According to it, by 2030 it is going  to be planned to achieve 17 goals. Based on the given global agreement, each  country should take measures to achieve the recommended goals.<br>
  It  should be noted that the report published by the UN also shows the importance  of the issue of education. The macroeconomic situation in countries divided  into four groups which is estimated by the UN. It allows to determine the  reforms carried out for the economic development of countries. Accordingly, the  development of the education system is important not only because it provides  literacy, but also because it forms the fundamental basis for the economic  stability of the country.<br>
  Reforms  aimed at developing and further strengthening the basic education system in  Uzbekistan require both the above documents and the current period of intensive  development. In this regard, a number of works are underway. Particularly, it  is safe to say that the adoption of the Decree of the President of the Republic  of Uzbekistan DP-5712 &ldquo;On approving the Concept of development of the public  education system of the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2030&rdquo; was an important  step.<br>
  According  to this document, a fundamental reform of the public education system is considered,  which means that in perspective the development will be taken to a new level. Indeed,  the financing issue was on the agenda for all periods of the reform. This  concept also focuses on the following aspects of financial security as  problematic issue:<br>
  -  the distribution and use of funds based on an effective and transparent system  is required at financing the public education system;<br>
  -  the basic part of expenditures allocated from the state budget to public  education institutions are spent on labor remuneration, while funds are not  allocated enough for updating training facilities, materials as well as  repairing school buildings.<br>
  In  our opinion, the importance of ensuring transparency in financing public  education is emphasized by the need for budgeting execution aimed at results. Additionally,  it should be noted that the relationship between groups in the estimate of  expenditures is also not stable. In particular, it is noted that the share of  salary financing in the structure of executed budget expenditures is high.<br>
  The  existence of these factors requires the need for the research.</p>
<strong><br clear="all">

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature review</strong><br>
  The  system of remuneration of teachers is important in reforming the education  system in our country. The introduction of a scientifically based approach to  the formation of salaries is to be considered urgent. An important task of this  category is to take into account the peculiarities of the teacher's activities  and to ensure the emergence of conditions that favorably affect the quality of  education.<br>
  In  his dissertation prof., D. Rakhmonov notes that similar cases exist in other  sectors of the social sphere. In particular, in 2007-2011, expenses for labor remuneration  in the state medical system averaged 83-84 percent. In this regard, as noted, &ldquo;it  is necessary not to reduce wages, but to purposefully increase the volume of  other expenses and optimize the relationship between wages and expenses for  them&rdquo;[1].<br>
  Also,  Associate P<a name="_GoBack"></a>rofessor M. Haydarov notes that &ldquo;per capita  financing is part of the rational use of budget funds, that is, ensuring the  efficient use of funds. The other side of the problem is to ensure the quality  of education so that graduates possess knowledge and skills that fully comply  with educational standards [2]&rdquo;.<br>
  On  the given issue, Professor of Pusan ​​University of foreign languages ​​in  South Korea, Azamat Akbarov made the following comments: &ldquo;Checking and controlling  the use of funds can be carried out in accordance with the present budget  legislation: budget execution and implementation of its cash service,  accounting procedures, etc. The introduction of a per capita financing system  for schools implies that all requirements for secondary educational  institutions remain valid [3]&rdquo;.<br>
  Russian  researchers have also studied the attitude of teachers due to financing. For  example, T. Klyachko and G. Tokareva analyzed aspects of wages and their impact  on education based on a questionnaire [4]. For the question whether they are  satisfied with their salaries, about 70 percent of teachers expressed  dissatisfaction. Because of the reduction in the workload in 2014–2016, more  than 1/3 of teachers expressed their full satisfaction with that. It is  noteworthy that a question was asked about how young people are interested to  work as a teacher at school. 36 percentage of those who answered this question pointed  out a connection between young people and a lack of risk of losing that job  place. These researchers made a conclusion that even if the salaries of schoolteachers  increased, they were not satisfied with the quality of education. The main  reason for this is the lack of a mechanism for influencing wages by assessing  the quality of education by parents.<br>
  In  our opinion, even the above scientific findings illustrate that the expenditure  rate per pupil does not allow limiting educational standards. Over the past  period, due to the &quot;lack of chairs&quot; in schools, the following trends  have been occurred:<br>
  -  A network of non-governmental school educational institutions has been  developed; <br>
  -  Additional lessons after classes - the creation of tutoring services;<br>
  -  A system of training centers has been formed to ensure successful participation  in entrance exams to higher educational institutions;<br>
  -  As well as it influenced on the organization of the educational process in  schools in two shifts.<br>

  During  the research, we tried to analyze the system of financing school education  through the eyes of teachers. According to it, the questionnaire was carried  out due to compiled questions designated for teachers. The survey consisted of questions  hosted on (<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DlEQeXMVADhy_DhWSv9W0ecjvDZSazPa8Ts-lOrlz6w/edit#responses">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DlEQeXMVADhy_DhWSv9W0ecjvDZSazPa8Ts-lOrlz6w/edit#responses</a>). This process was carried out in April-May 2020, where  teachers took part from different regions of Uzbekistan.<br>
  In  this questionnaire, a special attention was paid to such aspects as the  distance of the teacher to work, qualification categories, job rates, quality  of education, wage setting as well as the efficiency of using the director&rsquo;s  fund.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis and results</strong><br>
  It  should be noted that the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic  of Uzbekistan dated on September 30, 2019 No. 823 &ldquo;On the procedure for  improving material incentives for honored employees of educational  institutions&rdquo; was adopted. According to the Resolution, an updated version of  the mechanism for paying bonuses to teachers from the director&rsquo;s fund was  introduced. This resolution designates the formation of a working group of at  least seven people on the basis of the decision of the pedagogical council, as  well as the order of the director of the educational institution to pay bonuses.  It was emphasized that the structure of this working group includes  representatives of the parents of pupils, who will be rotated before each academic  year. Although the determination of this procedure allowed overcoming the  problem presented in the aforementioned study, but the questions made in the  questionnaire for the teachers helped to draw modern conclusions.<br>
  Initially,  an attention was paid to the determination of qualification categories of  teachers. In this regard, the answers to the questionnaire list the categories  available in the school system. During our research, we will try to assess the  impact on the quality of education and wages by grouping the indicated answers.<br>
  <strong><img src="1_Trends_in_the_development_of_the_place_and_role_of_teachers_in_financing_school_education_Vol_IX_Issue_I_clip_image002.png" alt="1_Trends_in_the_development_of_the_place_and_role_of_teachers_in_financing_school_education_Vol_IX_Issue_I" width="602" height="258" border="0"></strong> <strong> </strong><br>
  <strong>Figure 1. What is your qualification category? The  content of the answers to the question, in percent</strong><br>
  It  is noteworthy that the share of teachers with the highest category, conducting  their activities in school education in Uzbekistan of the total number of  teachers makes 3 percent [5], which is also reflected in our survey, and more  than 6.5 percent of respondents are teachers with the highest category (see  Figure 1) .<br>
  The  preservation of a small share of specialists of the highest category is determined  by increased requirements for this category or a decrease of attraction to it.<br>
  At  this stage, we will try to consider how qualification categories of teachers  influence other factors. To achieve this, we take the qualification category as  an unchanging factor in the context of survey responses. As variables, we will  formulate scientific conclusions regarding what the total share of their  answers will be.<br>
  To  begin with, we will determine the influence of this factor on the rate of work  of teachers.  In this regard, we will  place the qualification categories in the column of table 1. To the question  &ldquo;What job rate do you work for&rdquo;, we can associate the answers to the previous  question &ldquo;Your qualification category&rdquo; and provide information about the  category and at what job rate they conduct their activities. When we use the  category &ldquo;job rate&rdquo; in a question, we mean &ldquo;staffing position&rdquo;. The reason of  using the word &ldquo;job rate&rdquo; is to prevent misunderstandings in the questionnaire.<br>

<p>The  share of workers in one (full) staffing position made a large number, which was  equal to 71 percent, and employment in 0.75 staffing position was 19 percent.  Based on these figures, it should be noted that in school education, about 90  percent of teachers work full-time and about 10 percent in a staffing position.  We also make the following calculation to determine how many staffing positions  participate in the survey. As a result (1480 * 1.0 + 394 * 0.75 + 163 * 0.5 +  44 * 0.25), it makes 1868 staffing positions. Ultimately, during distribution  of 1868 staffing positions, it was revealed that 2081 teachers carry out their  activities. As well as, it can be seen the absence (of those participating in  the survey) of salary recipients on an &ldquo;hourly&rdquo; basis in the school system (see  Table 1).<br>
  Accordingly,  we draw attention to the conclusion of the researcher A. Sherov [6]. He  systematized the factors determining the effectiveness of fiscal policy. As a  certain part of the factors determining financial efficiency in the public  education system, he notes the following:<br>
  -  lack of criteria for &ldquo;staff turnover&rdquo; of teachers;<br>
  -  the ratio of the total number of teachers per staffing positions (this  indicator should not exceed 1);<br>
  -  a large number of long-term employees in the total number of teachers;<br>
  According  to A.U. Sherov, the ratio of the total number of teachers to the number of allocated  staffing positions is important in determining financial efficiency. In our research,  this indicator is 1.11 (the number of teachers is 2082/1868 staffing positions).  Thus, it can be noted that several teachers work in one staffing position.<br>
  Based  on our analysis, in terms of table 1, it can be drawn the following  conclusions:<br>
  -  it should be noted that the qualification category and the staffing position are  directly proportional, as the qualification category grows, the opportunities  to work in a larger staffing position expand;<br>
  -  the number of full-time employees is more than 70 percent;<br>
  -  it should be noted that the number of staffing positions is less than the  number of teachers, which is 1.11 teachers per staffing position, or an average  of 0.89;<br>
  -  being a specialist with a secondary special education, the probability of  working on 0.5 staffing position is increased,  while, the probability of working on part-time staffing position for a teacher with  the highest category is reduced;<br>
  -  the staffing position allocated to school education  &ldquo;gets behind&rdquo; the number of graduates of  pedagogical universities.<br>
  In  our research, we try to determine and evaluate the degree of satisfaction with  the work of teaching staff. To do this, we will carry out calculations based on  the principle of compiling the above table.<br>

<p>In  the expressed opinions of teachers regarding wages, a significant proportion is  the principle of &quot;due to experience.&quot; In its turn, the category of  experience can be used in two different meanings: the level of the  qualification category and the duration of the activity (work of experience).  About ¾ of the teachers noted the importance of setting wages depending on the work  of experience or qualification category. If 74 percent (103) of teachers with  the highest category wanted to be appointed due to the work of experience, consequently  the others may not be completely satisfied with their salaries. Considering,  that the work of experience is a factor serving for the payment of bonuses, and  not as a basic factor, many teachers immediately notified of the payment of bonuses  included to the salary. For example, 82 percent (363) of teachers with the  first category, with great experience, noted that &ldquo;experience&rdquo; is important. In  general, the following conclusions can be drawn from the data in table 2:<br>
  -  It was noted that most teachers should pay attention to the fact that  experience (work experience) is the main factor in calculating wages;<br>
  -  ¼ part of teachers of all categories, particularly with the highest categories,  indicated that wages should be formed due to the difficulty level of the  subject;<br>
  -  the number of teachers who teach natural sciences, less than others in the  teaching staff, emphasize that the subject they teach is not important in  determining their salaries;<br>
  -  in turn, teachers of social sciences, who occupy a large part compared to other  teachers, said that &quot;science is the main factor in determining  wages.&quot;<br>
  The  legislative documents emphasize that the basic salary of teachers in school  education is determined according to the qualification category. In our  opinion, the results of our research illustrate that taking into account the  experience and work experience of teachers in setting bonuses to the salary can  be an important factor in improving the quality of education.<br>
  In  the course of our analyzes, we study the numbers for encouraging teachers, that  is, paying bonuses from the director&rsquo;s fund. In the following table, we  consider the impact of the qualification category on the use of funds from the  director&rsquo;s fund. We also form a Table 3 in the order in which the previous  tables were created.<br>
  In  the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated on  September 30, 2019 no. 823 &ldquo;On the procedure for improving material incentives for  honored employees of educational institutions&rdquo;, it was noted that the number of  recipients of bonuses to the salary &ldquo;should not exceed 50 percent of the total  number of teachers, psychologists and library workers&rdquo;.<br>
  While  44 percent of those who noted that the incentive system in this order was fair,  the same number of teachers noted about the necessity of changing this  procedure or red tape is increased. On the other hand, 54 percent of teachers withthe  highest category recommended making changes to this procedure as well as they noted  about excess of red tape. In general, there were those who were not informed  about system of payment bonuses to the salary. Their total share was about 12  percent, and it should be noted that with the growth of the qualification  category, the lack of information about this procedure tends to decrease (see  Table 3).<br>

<p>In  our opinion, it would be reasonable to further increase the transparency of the  material incentive system for teachers and apply a digital-electronic procedure  for appointing bonuses. Besides, red tape elements will be decreased. It is  also necessary to organize, within the framework of schools, events to inform  the public about this decision in the pedagogical council and about the  possibility of receiving allowances through this procedure.<br>
  In  his study, the Russian scientist T. Suge-Maadyr analyzed some aspects of paying  salaries to teachers in public schools [7]. The qualifications of teachers will  be conditionally systematized into pedagogical categories. Therefore, the  category of the group should reflect the stimulation of its recipient, which  will require the teacher to constantly work on himself. It emphasizes that,  firstly, it should cover all categories and experience, and secondly, that the  incentive ratio should be progressive - in turn, each additional academic year  should be as a level function. If it is assumed that the teacher will achieve  great experience and qualifications due to 10-15 years of continuous working  activity, then it is assumed that the coverage of qualification experience can  also be formed using 10 or 15 wage rates. Thus, the total wage rate (T)  consists of two components and illustrates the following (see Formula 2.1):<br>
  <img src="1_Trends_in_the_development_of_the_place_and_role_of_teachers_in_financing_school_education_Vol_IX_Issue_I_clip_image004.png" alt="Figure 1. What is your qualification category? The content of the answers to the question, in percent" width="126" height="24"> (2.1) <br>
  Where  Т1is the compensation rate for the restoration of labor,  K is the ratio of the compensation rate for the recovering the labor force of  holders of intellectual labor, T2 is a ratio indicating the level of  qualification.<br>
  In  our opinion, it is important to pay attention to the component of experience in  the remuneration of teachers. The reason is that this component does not arise  from the day of graduation and it should be noted that social ability has been  accumulating over many years. Nowadays, in the practice of Uzbekistan, only the  qualification category (by the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the  Republic of Uzbekistan No. 275 dated on December 21, 2005) is established as a  basis for wages. The introduction of this procedure will lead to the following:<br>
  -  a classification of intellectual work will be provided as well as appropriate  financial motivation will be created;<br>
  -  a statement &ldquo;who has great experience will have a large income&rdquo; - allows working  on the principle of a market economy;<br>
  -  an increase of interest to conduct the long-term activity in the sphere– allows  to encouragement of experienced teachers;<br>
  -  an interest in the exchange of experience based on the practice of  &ldquo;teacher-student&rdquo; in the system will be increased.<br>
  In  conclusion, we believe that the introduction of a financial incentive mechanism  for teachers based on the appropriate methodology will create conditions for  improving the quality of education and increasing interest in the provision of  educational services.<br>
  In  our research, we also tried to pay attention to the distribution factor of  class hours. At this stage, it should be noted that the distribution of school  hours is of a great importance only for elementary and senior classes.<br>
  <img src="1_Trends_in_the_development_of_the_place_and_role_of_teachers_in_financing_school_education_Vol_IX_Issue_I_clip_image006.png" alt="Figure 2. Should school hours be allocated according to the teacher’s qualification category? The content of the answers to the question, in percent" width="578" height="225" border="0"> <br>
  <strong>Figure 2. Should school hours be allocated according  to the teacher&rsquo;s qualification category? The content of the answers to the  question, in percent</strong><br>
  As  the category increases at distributing school hours, the question was put in  terms of reducing workload per staffing position. It was emphasized that the main  part of indicated responses should be focused on the element of experience. In  particular, 36 percent of teachers agree with the existing mechanism for  distributing school hours (see Figure 2).<br>
  &nbsp;Overall,  when we systematically analyzed the answers to this question from the point of  view of qualification categories, it was noted that specialists with higher  education and second category specialists with higher education recommended the  component of &ldquo;experience&rdquo; in the distribution of school hours, while  specialists of the first and highest categories preferred existing distribution  practices. In short, while teachers pay more attention to its size in the lessons  distribution, they forget that the quality of education is caused by the  availability of additional time to prepare for the lesson.<br>
  In  our opinion, the popularization of the skills of highly qualified teachers and  the further development of the &ldquo;teacher-student&rdquo; system in this area will be served  as an important element in improving the quality of education. In this regard,  it is necessary to introduce the practice of classification in determining one staffing  position of academic hours for job payroll. Therefore, it will reflect the  classification of the volume of the academic load for the staff unit inversely  with the qualification category.<br>
  We  analyzed the aspects of achieving an improvement in the quality of education, associating  wages with labor productivity and its quality. In turn, we study the  relationship of factors affecting the quality of education and creating  conditions for it.<br>

  <strong>Figure 3. What do you think, on what factor does the  quality of education most depend on? The content of the answers to the  question, in percent</strong><br>
  Among  the factors affecting the quality of education, teachers emphasize the  importance of the number of pupils in the class and their interests. 55 percent  of respondents said that pupil occupancy was not regarded, while 20 percent  said that pupil interests were important (see Figure 3).<br>
  For  example, in Germany, taking into account the interests and abilities of pupils  has become a mechanism nationwide. In Germany, there is a teaching practice  where pupils under 10 years old are divided into three-level classes. Particularly,  1) gymnasiums that send clever students to colleges; 2) it is envisaged that pupils  (Realschule-) occupy a leadership position in the middle layers of society  (white-collar workers): 3) Pupils (Hauptschule) are divided into educational  groups for working in spheres involved in trade and other (blue-collar) types  of activity [8].<br>
  Additionally,  the researches conducted by A. Banerjee, E. Duflo, and M. Kremer prove that  poverty reduction can be achieved by taking into account the interests of pupils  to school education [9].<br>
  In  this regard, the establishment of Presidential schools in Uzbekistan from the  2019-2020 academic year is of particular importance. However, the fact that the  quota of pupils is small in these schools, which requires some changes in the  country, is educational system.<br>
  Thus,  in the previous chapter of our research, we also noted that the presence of the  &ldquo;lack of chairs in schools&rdquo; factor affects financing. In this part of our research,  teachers also noted that the probability of the influence of this factor on the  quality of education was preserved. It is known that a large number of pupils  in classes is due to the fact that the number of schools was not formed in  proportion to the number of pupils as well as it plays a major role.<br>
  In  our opinion, taking into account the results of international experience and  research, we believe that the following should be taken into consideration in  our country:<br>
  -to  divide students into classes due to their interests after primary education;<br>
  -  when dividing students into classes by discipline - by exact, natural and  social sciences.<br>
  During  analysis of factors affecting the sustainability of the quality of education,  the teachers were asked the following question: &ldquo;Are there all conditions for giving  a lesson in the classroom?&rdquo; 53 percent of respondents said that there are  conditions for teaching a modern lesson, while 47 percent of teachers noted  several factors. In particular, they noted about lack of money at school, a  laboratory is necessary and there are problems with connecting to the Internet.<br>
  Analyzing  the intersection of answers to the last two questions above, we will try to  form a scientific conclusion which allows to improve the quality of education.<br>

<p>Because  of our research, it should be noted that 50 percent of teachers who indicated  that all conditions for teaching were created in the classroom, suggested that  there were fewer pupils in the class. 55 percent of teachers who consider pupils&rsquo;  interest are important, agree with classroom conditions. One of the interesting  cases at the intersection of answers was that 67percent of those who assessed  the provision of literature as unsatisfactory indicated that there all  conditions for giving a lesson in the classroom (see Table 4).<br>
  The  following conclusions can be drawn from the data in table 4:<br>
  -  along with the necessary changes in ensuring the quality of education - The  fact that the Internet problem is the most basic, as well as it is supported by  all; respondents;<br>
  -  The second important factor is taking into account the interests of pupils,  while the factor of pupil&rsquo;s occupancy is of a primary importance;<br>
  -  Allocated to the lesson - more than 45 minutes is important for the social  sciences;<br>
  -  Salaries paid to the teachers, as well as pupils&rsquo; health are not the main  factors in ensuring the quality of education.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
  Consequently,  our researches have shown that financing the school education should consider  the factors that have a primary influence on the quality of education, as well  as the most important factors are the classification of system of teachers'  remuneration.</p>
