Paper Title :<br>EXTENT OF CHILD LABOUR IN JAHANGIR-PURI: A SLUM AREA OF DELHI</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This study examines the situation of child labor of slum area of G Block of Jahangir-Puri of North Delhi, with respect to socio-economic factors. With incidence of child labor, the family characteristics of children belonging to slum areas were also investigated. Some of the questions pertaining to the loss of childhood of slum children have been raised. The association between these factors and learning outcomes is also examined within the stipulated constraints. The study can be used for making some effective policies, in slums of North Delhi to fill the gap between reality and hope for removing the menace of Child Labor. One of the key objectives of the study was to understand and analyze various factors that cause children to get involved in work at a tender age. A wide range of factors may actually be involved in making a child work and often it is the combined effect of these factors. However, some of these factors are believed to have a direct link with the incidence of child labor. This study made an attempt to understand the causal relationship between the literacy and income of the household with the involvement of children in work. Moreover, the study throws light, on future prospects of slum children and gives some suggestions to save the precious childhood.

  <h1>&nbsp;About the Study</h1>
  <p>Children  are the greatest gift to humanity and Childhood is an important and  impressionable stage of human development as it holds the potential to the  future development of any society. Children who are brought up in an  environment, which is conducive to their intellectual, physical and social  health, grow up to be responsible and productive members of society. Every nation  links its future with the present status of its children. By performing work  when they are too young for the task, children unduly reduce their present  welfare or their future income earning capabilities, either by shrinking their  future external choice sets or by reducing their own future individual  productive capabilities. Under extreme economic distress, children are forced  to forego educational opportunities and take up jobs which are mostly  exploitative as they are usually underpaid and engaged in hazardous conditions.  There is a strong effect of child negatively associated with his or her  capacity to attend school. Child labor restricts the right of children to  access and benefit from education and denies the fundamental opportunity to  attend school. Child labor, thus, prejudices affects their health and safety.<br>
    In  recent times there has been a renewed attack on child labor citing grounds of  physical, moral and psychological trauma for the children and loss of  childhood. Such arguments have been stimulated by recent debates on human  rights, human capital formation and international labor standards. It is argued  that child labor exists in developing countries because there are both demand  for and supply of it. Faced with poverty, inequality, social norms,  credit-land-labor market imperfections, high fertility and unpredictable  employment scenario children are sent to work in most cases by their parents.  The supplementary income of children raises their nutritional standards,  enables their siblings to continue education and enhance their skill and future  prospect of employment. On the other hand producers demand child labor because  of substantially lower wages paid to children. Therefore child labor exists.  The incidence of child labor is accepted either as an undesired reality or as  an unavoidable necessity.<br>
    Globalization  and liberalization has increased the incidence of subcontracting substantially  enhancing opportunity of utilization of child labor. The recent focus on human  development and human capital formation along with the fact that substantial  number of children works in hazardous and exploitative situation has led to  policies to eradicate all forms of child labor - children engaged full-time in  wage employment, children working part-time along with schooling and those  contributing to family labor in domestic as well as economic activities.  Moreover the recent globalization trends have set in motion two contrasting  forces. On one hand the developed countries are increasingly imposing  restrictions on importable produced by child labor thereby putting pressure on  local producers to stop employing children on the other hand the same global  competitive forces are inducing the local competitors to cut down wage bill by  employing women and children.<br>
    In India,  the problem of child labor is well recognized. There are varying estimates of  the number of working children in the country due to differing concepts and  methods of estimation. Children are engaged in various types of work, including  those that are classified as 'hazardous', i.e. harmful to the physical,  emotional, or moral well-being of children. An estimated 2 million children  work in hazardous industries. Although there are inter-state and inter-regional  variations in India, the factors that generate child labor, and hazardous child  labor in particular, include parental poverty and illiteracy; social and  economic circumstances; lack of awareness; lack of access to basic and  meaningful quality education and skills; high rates of adult unemployment and  underemployment, and cultural values of the family and society. The  supplementary income of children raises their nutritional standards, enables  their siblings to continue education and enhance their skill and future  prospect of employment. On the other hand producers demand child labor because  of substantially lower wages paid to children. Therefore child labor exists.  The incidence of child labor is accepted either as an undesired reality or as  an unavoidable necessity.<br>
    Globalization  and liberalization has increased the incidence of subcontracting substantially  enhancing opportunity of utilization of child labor. The recent focus on human  development and human capital formation along with the fact that&rsquo;s substantial  number of children works in hazardous and exploitative situation has led to  policies to eradicate all forms of child labor - children engaged full-time in  wage employment, children working part-time along with schooling and those  contributing to family labor in domestic as well as economic activities.  Moreover the recent globalization trends have set in motion two contrasting  forces. On one hand the developed countries are increasingly imposing  restrictions on importable produced by child labor there by putting pressure on  local producers to stop employing children on the other hand the same global  competitive forces are inducing the local competitors to cut down wage bill by  employing women and children.<br>
    In  India, the problem of child labor is well recognized. There are varying  estimates of the number of working children in the country due to differing  concepts and methods of estimation. Children are engaged in various types of  work, including those that are classified as 'hazardous', i.e. harmful to the  physical, emotional, or moral well-being of children. An estimated 2 million  children work in hazardous industries. Although there are inter-state and  inter-regional variations in India, the factors that generate child labor, and  hazardous child labor in particular, include parental poverty and illiteracy;  social and economic circumstances; lack of awareness; lack of access to basic  and meaningful quality education and skills; high rates of adult unemployment  and under employment, and cultural values of the family and society.<br>
    Child  labor is in focus for last two decades as it robs children of the chance to  enhance human capital. As per the NSSO survey child Workers have declined from  9.1 million in 1993 to 5.8 million in 2004, declining by 0.04 percent per  annum. Incidence of Child Labor is more in Rural areas, higher among 10-14  years age-group, and more prominent among Boys, and quite disparate across  states. Another 30 million children in 2003-04, about 13 percent of total, are  &lsquo;Nowhere Children&rsquo;. Incidence of Domestic Duties and Nowhere Children are  higher among girls. Poverty emerges to be necessary condition thereby preparing  the breeding ground but not sufficient to drive the children to the labor  market. Lack of Educational infrastructure is found to be very important in  this respect. This includes not only the physical but also the human component,  which is emerging to be more crucial. Poverty alleviation programmes must  therefore be complemented by expansion of educational infrastructure for  eradicating child labor.</p>
  <h1>Objectives  of Study</h1>
  <h2>Examine the socio economic background of child labor;</h2>
  <h2>Examine the family characteristics of children belonging to  slum areas;</h2>
  <h2>Examine the reasons behind compelling them to work in this  innocent age;</h2>
  <h2>Analyze the medical facilities and wages provided to them;</h2>
  <h2>Present an overview regarding their future prospects and  loss of their childhood which is a matter of concern in the present scenario.</h2>
  <p>Child  Labor has been in the focus of Development economics from quite a long time  (see ILO (2002) for an annotated bibliography). There has been substantive  number of studies on Child Labor internationally. Theoretical and empirical  studies on Child Labor seek answers to three basic questions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>What causes child labor?</li>
    <li>What are the effects of child labor on human  development?</li>
    <li>How different policies affect magnitude and  forms of child labor?</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  <p>The  study is based on primary data as survey was conducted in G Block of Jahangir  Puri slum of North Delhi, selected purposively and randomly. The population  size of G block was 200 jhuggis. The sample size was taken 20 percent of the  households i.e. 40 through random sampling technique. The religion, caste and  occupational characteristics do differentiate various households. All these  factors have significant influence on the choice of sending child at work and  parents approach to the education of their children. Not all children from the  slums go to schools. But most of goes out for work. In view of these factors  and lack of basic information on slums characteristics and child labor in slum  households, it was decided to select a purposive random sample. Slums were  identified on the basis of location, number of households and child labor.<br>

    Filling  up of interview schedule by research scholar in Jahangir Puri slum<br>
    Child  labor is defined as the children in the age group of 5-14 years who are either  self-employed or are wage workers. Here usual principal status is considered.  According to NSS in India, the economic activity status of persons is captured  in terms of usual status or current status approach. A person is considered to  be employed in the usual status category if he or she had pursued gainful  economic activity for a relatively longer time span in the immediately  preceding year (365 days) prior to the date of survey. This is known as the  Usual Principal Status. If a person had spent relatively shorter time span in  the preceding one year prior to the NSSO survey then this is considered as  Usual Subsidiary Activity Status. Primarily usual principal activity status is  used in this study. Using unit level records the children are grouped into  different categories viz Self Employed (working in own account enterprises),  Technical/ mechanical, Performing Domestic Duties and Tea shop workers and  others children who are either going to school or working or both.</p>
  <h1>Tools  For Study Undertaken </h1>
  <p>Interview  schedules were administered by going door to door. And there were two types of  interview schedule, one for the household and second for working children of  that house. In study. Discussions with the community members also helped to  draw come conclusions regarding their poor living standard. Microsoft Excel was  used for the analysis of data. Average scores were computed and main findings  of the data are presented.</p>
  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>Compelling  circumstances and family mores and tradition cause child labor of varying  character and intensity. A high prevalence of child labor is linked to poverty  and to poor quality or availability of education. Children in poor families  work because the family needs the extra income. It is assumed that poor  households with no savings and assets and inability to borrow have no choice  but to send their children out to work. As parent&rsquo;s income rise they are able  to send their children to school rather than to work.<br>

    Filling  up of interview schedule from a household<br>
    Jahangir  Puri, which lies in north-west Delhi has a large slum cluster comprising of  rag-picking families, mostly Bengali Muslims migrated from eastern part of  India particularly from Bengal, Bihar and adjoining areas of Bangladesh border.  Jahangir Puri has a dense population of more than 5 lakhs and it is basically a  resettlement colony divided into 12 blocks. The problem of rag picking is more  prevalent in Blocks such as C &amp; CD Park, EE (E Extn), G, H, K and I blocks.  Although, for research purpose, pilot survey is done only in G block of  Jahangir Puri and there are approximately 200 households residing in these  jhuggis and engaged in this enchanting trade of pick and sale of rags. In  sample, selected through random sampling, Hindus comprise of about 30 percent  and the rest are Muslims. The issues prevailing in the colony are unemployment,  poverty, illiteracy, poor health and sanitation, domestic violence, child  labor, female feticide, alcoholism, drug abuse etc Rag-picking as such is  highly rampant in Jahangir Puri. Because of lack of hygiene the children as  well as parents are prone to various diseases such as tuberculosis, scabies  (skin disease) and asthma etc.<br>

  <h2>Salient  Characteristics of Sampled Households </h2>
  <p>Household  profile tries to encapsulate the socio economic background of the children. The  household interview schedule formed an important component of this study  because one can infer the socio economic condition and the aspects which  actually compelled a child to work. The educational decisions are governed by  the domestic circumstances whether to send a child to school or not, and  whether and when to withdraw a child from school. In India, especially in the  poor sections of the community, child labor cannot be taken in isolation. It  has to be seen in the wider social context. Thus both home and child factors  are important for determining the educational status and attainment of the  child. Keeping in view the close relationship, between these two factors, the  survey of the sampled households becomes a significant part of this study.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;Working  Children of Slum Households </h3>
  <p>Table 1 shows the incidence of child labor. It depicts that all  households having one working children and 22.3 percent households have more  than one working children. Here working children age is less than 14. The  survey reveals the intensity of child labor in slum households of Jahangir Puri</p>

  <h3>Migrants in Jahangir-Puri </h3>
  <p>The  National Commission on urbanization has described that urbanization in India  emerged in response to the push and pull factors, which resulted in a large  migration from the villages to urban areas. The illiterate, semi-skilled and  manual workers have been migrating in search of better employment opportunities  and partly due to the demand created for skilled and semi-skilled labor in  industrial and commercial undertakings.<br>
    In  figure 1, it is shown that approximately 90 percent families are migrated from  other states and nearly 10 percent families belong to Delhi and nearby places.  It is to be noticed that migration in itself pressurize urban cities for  creating more employment as most of the migrants come to get employment in big  cities. And lack of employment or income leads the poor people to slums and  further a vicious circle starts which create many other problems like child  labor. </p>

  <h3>Types of Families </h3>
  <p>In  Figure 2, the pie diagram, blue area shows the households having joint family  and red area shows households having nuclear family. And it is obvious from the  pie chart that households having joint family are less in numbers than  households having nuclear families. It is important to notice that the size of  the family with insufficient income may compel a child to work for earning  his/her own living to fulfill various needs. A larger family size implies  higher dependency ratio, making it difficult to afford the education of all the  children and pay due attention to them. </p>

  <h3>Households Head </h3>
  <p>Table 2  further reveals that 57.5 percent households are headed by males and 42.5  percent headed by females. The field study put more light on the fact that most  of males are regular in taking alcohol and most of the females who head  families are widows. Background of the family may shed light in understanding  that why child labor is still prevalent. As alcoholism in males interrelated  with many other problems like domestic violence, physical and verbal abuse of  child, and illiterate widows find hard to get employment to earn sufficient  income. These circumstances may coerce a child to work.</p>

  <h3>Housing Condiiton </h3>
  <p>Slums are a universal phenomenon and exist in practically all the  cities across the world. Delhi alone has approximately 1,100 big and small  unauthorized settlements comprising six lakhs jhuggi forming various clusters  of slums, with around 3.2million people living in these. <br>

    <strong>A  House in Slum: Half-Jhuggi and Half-Concrete</strong><br>
    Justice  P.B. Sawant has clearly mentioned that shelter for a human being is not mere  protection for his limbs and life. It is in his home where he has opportunity  to grow physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually. Right to shelter,  therefore, includes right to adequate living space, safe and decent structure,  clean and decent surroundings, sufficient light, pure air and water,  electricity, sanitation and drainage facilities. Slum people are devoid of all  these essential physical facilities and they are always living under the fear  of &lsquo;unsettlement&rsquo;. <br>
    Around 65 per cent of the sampled houses have only one room and  35% two rooms only. Rooms are dingy, small and without proper ventilation. Only  a few have the toilet facility at home, only around 12 % people have individual  tap water supply, rest of them are dependent on the community tap and tanker  water. Around 50 % spend one hour daily and around 20 % two hours daily. </p>

    Poor people in slums not even able to make their pucca houses and  they are conditioned to live in jhuggis. In Jahangir Puri survey 95 percent  houses are having jhuggis and merely 5 percent households have pucca houses. In  figure 4 x axis shows type of houses and y axis shows the number of households.  Figure 5 shows the worst conditions that only negligible households have  toilets (shown in blue color in pie chart) and all people defecate in open  areas (shown by red color in pie chart) which in addition give birth to many  diseases and poor health.</p>

  <h2>Work  Summary of Child Labor &nbsp;</h2>
  <p>It is  very sad that in which age they deserve to be cared loved and  social-educational development, they are working for their survival. It is a  shame for the society that child labor persists. The field survey in this area  shows that the average age of child when he starts working is 10.19 which is  really very low and a matter of concern. </p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>With  regard to child labor in India, Justice Subba Rao, the former Chief Justice of  India, rightly remarked; &ldquo;Social justice must begin with the child. Unless a  tender plant is properly nourished, it has little chance of growing into strong  and useful tree. So, first priority in the scale of justice should be given to  the welfare of children. Supreme Court has played an important Role to control  the problem of child labor and has shown its concern for child labor by  bringing occupations or processes under the courts order regard to the  prevailing socio-economic conditions, it is not possible to prohibit child  labor altogether and in fact, any such move may not be socially or economically  acceptable to large masses of people. That is why Article 24 limits the  prohibition against employment of child labor only to factories, mines or other  hazardous employments. The Central Government was directed to persuade the  workmen to send their children to a nearby school and arrange not only for the  school fees to be paid but also provide free of charge, books and other  facilities such as transportation etc<br>
    In spite  of various stringent labor laws the problem of child labor put forward a  serious challenge to the development process in the underdeveloped economies.  Asia is leading in this respect with 60 percent of child labor of the world  followed by sub-Saharan Africa (23 percent). West Asia and Latin America  together constitute eight percent and North Africa accounts for 6 percent of  child labor of the world. Work participation rate among children is 19 percent  in Asia, 16 percent in Latin America and 15 percent in North Africa. In sharp  contrast to this, work participation rate of children in the developed  countries is only 2 percent<br>
    Based on  the survey data, following observations are noticeably revealed.<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All houses of this particular block of  Jahangir Puri slum having working children in their families. And most of the  families belong to BPL (Below Poverty Line) category.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the families are nuclear and  belong to muslim community. <br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, nearly 95 percent houses are  jhuggis and don&rsquo;t have toilet facilities and don&rsquo;t have hygienic lifestyle.  Which make it obvious that diseases are more prominent.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The percentage of child labor in work  demand more than 8 hours is highest. Average stipulated hours of working came  to be 9.5 hours. This clearly indicates the need for specific interventions in  slums that have not been brought under the notification process yet.<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the working children started  working in tender age of 10 or earlier. And more than 67 percent left schools  due to poor family income. It is clear that issue of livelihoods security is a  real need of the hour in slum area of North Delhi. <br>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 48% of the parents said that they did  not send their children to school as they could not afford their education.  This came out as a more important reason than the lack of interest in  schooling. Also, around 14% clearly said that the child was required to work to  supplement the family income and hence, could not be sent to school. This  clearly brings out that poverty is an important reason responsible for child  labor<br>
    7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligible percentage of working children  (5-14 years) said that they had received any kind of training for developing  their skills. <br>
    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly 50 percent of children are getting  victimized of bad social environment and prone to be indulging themselves in  bad habits.<br>
    9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child labor supplementing their families  by their income so unable to save for themselves due to inadequate wages.<br>
    10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few have idea of leaving job till their  family conditions improve, while most of them have no idea to be out of this  vicious circle of low income.<br>
    11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical assistance is very poor at work and  mostly wages are cut during leave because of illness. <br>
    By  seeing conclusions we can infer that the hypothesis made for the study stands  true as a high prevalence of child labor is linked to poverty and to poor  quality or availability of education. Children in poor families work because  the family needs the extra income. It is assumed that poor households with no  savings and assets and inability to borrow have no choice but to send their  children out to work. As parent&rsquo;s income rise they are able to send their  children to school rather than to work. The more revelations tell that, mostly  child workers are stuck in the vicious circle of work and having no clue to be  free from the menace. <br>
    <strong>Future  a matter of concern</strong><br>
    Expressed  in a generalized sense, the above factors constitute building blocks of a vicious  circle of continuing educational underdevelopment and are sustained by each  other. To achieve a virtuous circle of development, a straight jacket approach  of achieving demand and supply equilibrium has neither worked in the past, nor  would work in the future. As the regions/social groups progress towards  universal participation, the strategies to meet the basic learning needs of the  marginalized groups of population require an approach which is future-oriented  rather than extension of the established practices meant for some other groups  of population.<br>
    City  planners never anticipated the large influx of the migratory population and  their civic needs. They could not provide adequate facilities at affordable  costs, which has led to the emergence of slums/ghettos, where people prefer to  live without basic amenities for various compulsions.<br>
    &quot;Poverty  is not only a problem of low incomes; rather, it is multi-dimensional problem  that includes low access to opportunities for developing human capital and to  education&quot;. Slum children too face educational deprivation in terms of  accessibility and quality as well.</p>
