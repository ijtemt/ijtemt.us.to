<p>Abstract  —The issue in question turns out to be very current in relation to the  continuous increase of natural disasters and the consequent damage attributable  to them, the analysis of this subject can not be separated, however, by their  awareness of the increasing use of public resources necessary to cope with the  huge Costs essential to the implementation of actions aimed at the  reconstruction of the affected areas. The analysis the conduct  in this paper refers to a study of the different types of natural disasters,  issues related to these and the identification of opportunities offered by the  insurance system by identifying the possible profiles of the different types of  coverage just natural disasters. In sub-order, in the  course of the work it was desired to single out the most common forms and the  main methodological approaches to insurance risk arising from its catastrophic  phenomena.</p>
<p>Keywords-component;  Insurance, catastrophic risks, no man made events</p>
<h1>Type  and taxonomy of catastrophic risks: the vision of insurance companies </h1>
<p>In recent years, the frequency and severity of events related to  catastrophic  events have increased considerably (Angilletta, 2009, Schwarz, 2008, 2009,  2010) and therefore are also heightened the problems related not only to the  aspects of human security but merely including those related to more general  economic resources necessary to cover the legal costs and Reconstruction (Bode,  1999). In Italy, for example, note that in the second half of the 90s, there  were well over 300 floods, with an average frequency of at least three per year  and with an intensity that can cause damage more than relevant.  At the higher frequency and intensity of catastrophic events recorded here and  just highlighted is added thus to an increase in insured losses and a marked  increase in insurance density as well as the actual value of the insured property. The result of the  presented effect due on increased cost that insurance companies are called to  bear to address precisely these natural phenomena characterized by high  uncertainty and apparently unrelated to the will and action of man.</p>

<p>These  effects involve, among other things, a substantial modification of the main  approaches to governance by governments (national and local) and consequently  to a change in the guidelines also due to the problems associated with climate  change and the effects that it can either raise the frequency and intensity of  natural disasters.<br>
  The  analysis of the graph produced and expressed in Figure 1, shows how the natural  disasters of human origin - in literature defined man-made - are numerically  higher than those in natural other evidence deduced from exposure graphics is  the peak of events recorded in the recent years.</p>

  Source: our processing of data from  Aon Benfield</p>
<p>Recent  research conducted was clearly increased in recent decades, the costs and  therefore the economic value of the damage caused by natural disasters;  phenomenology that this can only be due to the increased concentration of the  population also living in the city, which become increasingly large and that  have developed in areas too often an area exposed to strong catastrophe risks.<br>
  Before  going fully in the topic covered by the chapter and related to macroeconomic  implications subsequent to the occurrence of catastrophic events, it is  appropriate to make a brief discussion of its major catastrophic events. In  particular, we will refer to those natural phenomena on which human action has  no impact and which is not found no possible preventive intervention to  mitigate the entity or to control their spread.</p>
<p>The  various natural disasters in the literature (Migliorini, 1981; Alexander, 1990)  are generally distinguished and classified according to the following  classification:<br>
  ·Events due to natural  causes;<br>
  ·Technological risks;<br>
  ·Epidemics or pandemics;<br>
  ·Terrorism.<br>
  Within  this classification, we will mainly examined the risks related to catastrophic  events caused by natural phenomena characterized by events. These phenomena may,  in turn, be divided into six different types that occur and by intervention of  the single Nature and wherein, as said, the work of man has no direct impact.  Natural events or as a taxonomy overseas used to call &quot;No Man Made Events&quot; can be classified into:<br>
  ·Earthquake;<br>
  ·Tsunami / Tsunami;<br>
  ·Volcanic Eruptions;<br>
  ·Floods;<br>
  ·Floods;<br>
  ·Storms<br>
  ·Weathering:<br>
  ·Hurricanes;<br>
  ·Storms;<br>
  ·Tornadoes.</p>
<h1>The  management of catastrophic risks</h1>
<p>The management of catastrophic risks through the capital market with  derivatives or insurance-linked securities in Italy is a new frontier for the  insurer to cover the risk arising from the portfolios of insured policies and  in its various forms can be if there is a stability of a financial market  alternative method for the management of catastrophic risks.<br>
  The current liquidity conditions in the financial markets and in  particular on the Italian an obstacle difficult to overcome in the present  historical stage for the success of operations issue of securities linked to  risk of the occurrence of natural catastrophe.&nbsp;Also a problem for the  spread of this type of security is the lack of perception and professionalism  of the Italian financial market with respect to these particular insurance  risks. This affects the efficient pricing for these activities, also due to the  lack of knowledge of actuarial methods of risk assessment.<br>
  However, securities indexed to the risk of catastrophe contain a type of  insurance risk, which by its nature is different from the financial and,  therefore, it is poorly correlated to the typical risks in the capital market.&nbsp;Therefore,  these securities may be included in the portfolios of investment, to improve  the quality and diversification, opening up spaces for the success of the issue  of bonds linked to insurance risk in question, even in a financial market like  the Italian one. </p>
<h1>The  models for disasters under Solvency II</h1>
<p>A specific model is implemented by companies to the risk of pricing or  subscription, which arises from the possibility that the premiums received are  not sufficient to cover future claims, especially if you are experiencing  catastrophic events. The insurer generally estimate the frequency of exposure  to claims, large claims and natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, storms,  etc.. Using simulation models, stochastic or deterministic, the results are  validated by sensitivity analyzes and stress tests. addition, the company  determines the possible loss scenarios and risk capital required to cover them,  also taking into account the type of reinsurance  structure available, the net retention of  premiums / risks  assumed and coverage.  To define the level of reinsurance the undertaking shall models that consider  the creation of value estimated from risk capital measure to evaluate the  efficiency and adequacy of the solutions to choose from. Specific risk analysis  allow the company to define for each type of business structure reinsurance,  the level of retention and the reinsurance capacity needed to mitigate exposure  to individual risk / event, which is derived from insurance contracts in the  portfolio.<br>
  These models are the basis on which the activity of the large insurance  groups operating in the European market.&nbsp;The characteristic of this market  is to provide a raised concentration in a few large transnational groups with  vested interests in Europe but extended to the American market, Japanese,  Chinese, etc. .. Of these groups to the prudential supervision is exercised by  the cooperation of the authorities of the countries where the Group operates  and under the coordination of the Authority which oversees the parent company.<br>
  The European Supervisory Authorities and the market are talking about  what are the guidelines in the implementation of Solvency II for the component  modelling of natural disasters, as part of their internal model of risk  management, with the aim to form a proper &quot;good practice&quot; in the  insurance industry. The increasing use of models for disasters will occur in  companies with an internal model, which is favorable in the calculation of  capital requirements. Obviously, each insurance company is different and has  different needs to be considered, therefore what may be appropriate for a not  so to another state and the documentation of Solvency II has not yet been  implemented, lacking the common reference point regulatory. The requirements of  Solvency II on the subject are complex, as well as the interpretation of this  or that general principle, which require appropriate clarifications. Solvency  II then is the moment of reflection in which the reflection is encouraged to  &quot;good practices&quot;. The Supervisory Authority has the responsibility to  validate and authorize the use of models for the management of catastrophe  risks by coordinating the Supervisor of residence of the parent company and the  active cooperation of other authorities who may be considering for local  exceptions, the model is efficient and effective. Businesses from their hand to  the Supervisory Authority must demonstrate compliance of their internal model  on disasters with the most stringent requirements of Solvency II. The internal  processes will be assessed for their suitability to manage catastrophic risks,  their proper implementation, their effective use in the strategic choices of  the company and their proper documentation. Using the risk-based approach of  Solvency II is conceivable that appropriate processes are adopted, the most  efficient possible, to manage catastrophic risks, including for the purpose of  compliance with the solvency requirements arising from the modelling of catastrophic  risks.<br>
  For companies that do not use their own internal model of risk  management, it should be borne in mind that the models for disasters are  required by insurance companies to estimate losses from extreme natural  catastrophes, as they (although large) is not have historical data to model  these risks adequately. In fact, for the simulation of extreme losses sellers  of templates for significant disasters employ scientific knowledge and build  models to recreate the underlying physical processes. It is then a limit on how  a company can treat its low frequency and high severity events without  replicating the scientific knowledge required to build the original model and  if it is suitable for their needs. The assumptions and methods used and should  always be well understood by the company in their effects and this adequately  documented.<br>
  With the validation of the models under Solvency II will harden, then a  &quot;good practice&quot; and will be effective robust instruments of  prudential supervision, and for the insurance of risks related to catastrophic  events are certainly desirable.</p>
<h1>Future  developments</h1>
<p>Events related to natural disasters are rare, and a time series of data  often does not contain all of the dangers and therefore often considerable risk  estimation is underestimated. For example, if a certain area is prone to many  hurricanes and tsunamis, it could happen that almost nothing has happened in a  long series (100 years), with one notable exception. Well before that event if  it had been built a model for the hurricane on a historical basis would have  made a mistake: the model would not consider events that could have an impact  on the frequency and severity  of  losses.   Recent events  have shown   that after a   volcanic eruption has resulted in a direct destruction and the issue of  ash that can paralyze air traffic, a tsunami may lead to nuclear disaster that  occurred in Japan in 2011, the business model storms during the months winter  but there is also the risk of summer storms. Therefore, the length of historical  data may not be sufficient to capture the impact of an event related to a  natural catastrophe and the insurer may not have made the necessary adjustments  of models purchased from outside of the insurance or do not have the  appropriate guidelines to make confident on the sound, prudent business.<br>
  In order then to standards of business conduct would be necessary to  establish the requirements for the conduct of the business of insurance to  ensure that customers are treated fairly, both before and after a contract is  signed to the point where all the obligations arising from a contract have been  met.<br>
  The new requirements under Solvency II and the international principles  for the conduct of insurance will help to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>strengthen consumer  confidence in the insurance industry;</li>
  <li>minimize the risk that  insurers follow business models that are not sustainable or could pose  reputational risk, contributing to their financial stability;</li>
  <li>support for a sound and  prudent management in the insurance sector through the creation of a level  playing field with regard to the basis on which companies can compete and  maintain acceptable marketing practices with regard to the fair treatment of  customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the above it appears that it is necessary to explore the theme of  which is the &quot;good practice&quot; to deal with the damage caused by  natural disasters, such as modelling of disasters is compatible with prudential  solvency requirements of businesses. Not necessarily the &quot;current  practices&quot; insurance companies or those available on the market are the  &quot;good practices&quot; for the industry and stakeholders, including  policyholders and the state.<br>
  The launch of new scientific research focused on specific Italian  situation, the more experience from past events, the strengthening of risk  management systems and the planning of public interventions for prevention,  fuelling a debate on issues involving coverage of risks related to natural  disasters, especially those due to climate change, are at this stage the  condition needed to better understand how to manage these risks. The entry into  force of Solvency II will then make confident on the ability of insurers to  manage catastrophic risks efficiently and responsibilities of the supervisory  authorities to validate their internal models so that they take into account  local specificities. The overall objective is to protect all the interests at  stake, inspired by the value that the Italian harm to human solidarity, and  support a new Italian idea of sustainable development.</p>

It deals with a particular  interest in the area of technological innovation, risk management and  management / marketing service companies, mainly insurance. E 'was an adjunct  professor of insurance, already thirty years old, the University of Salerno  (six AA), at the Stoa (where he coordinated the &quot;Master in Insurance  Management&quot;, funded by the ESF / Ministry of Education and sponsored by  ANIA) and for over 10 years (to date) is Professor of Economics and Management  of insurance companies in the Faculty of Economics of the University of Naples.  He has published numerous papers on insurance, including monographs adopted in  several Italian Universities</li>
  <li><strong>Giovanni Di Trapani</strong>, from June 2010, has been&nbsp;working as a  Researcher&nbsp;in the field of economics and management of insurance  enterprises. With regard to the increasingly relevant issue of the damages  caused by natural calamities, he studies and analyzes the role and behaviour of  risk management when&nbsp;applying specific insurance covers, particularly to  address catastrophic risks. He has recently carried out studies aimed at  finding a solution to the evolution&nbsp;of the distribution channels ICT,  including theintroduction of new market-driven or technology-driven services.  Up to May 2010, Giovanni studied Tourism and Cultural Heritage Management,  particularly looking at management, consumption and development of the cultural  heritage. Giovanni Di Trapani has also specialized in the study of those  actions aimed at developing the existent cultural heritage, in its tangible and  intangible forms i.e. the study of new, integrated and sustainable supplies  available in specific geographical areas. With regard to production and  creative consumption, he has studied and analyzed the network, districts and  the cultural clusters of some Italian and foreign territories, and defined  policies aimed at rejuvenating the city and the urban waterfront.</li>
