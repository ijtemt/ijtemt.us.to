<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The objective of the study is to assess the extent of the implementation of developmentally appropriate curriculum in the preparatory level in the eight schools in the Diocese of Novaliches as an aid in enhancing the development and enhancement of the curriculum in the Diocese. This study made use of descriptive survey type of research that utilized locally constructed questionnaire as primary data gathering tool. Essentially, the implementation of DAC in the light of the following domains of the curriculum namely, language competency, cognitive development, personal development, socio-emotional development, and motor development was assessed in aid of curriculum enhancement. It is imperative that teachers incorporate a wide variety of experiences, materials and equipment, and teaching strategies in implementing the developmentally appropriate curriculum to accommodate a broad range of children’s individual differences in prior experiences, maturation rates, styles of learning, needs, and interests. The identified gaps and weaknesses in the implementation of DAC in the Diocese of Novaliches can become a springboard in enhancing the curriculum, activities, and physical set up of the school in order to provide quality and meaningful developmentally appropriate practices among preparatory pupils.  Though there is much strength identified in the implementation of DAC, the schools in the Diocese of Novaliches cannot fully realize its successful implementation not unless the vital issues and problems have been addressed. An enhancement program is proposed by the researcher to further improve the implementation of the program in the Diocese of Novaliches.

    INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p>Educating  the preschool children is still a top priority today as it was many years ago  when schooling first began as an effort to teach and promote citizenship.  Times have changed tremendously since then,  as the focus of basic education has shifted to preparing children for success  in an ever-changing society.  These days,  children are learning more at a younger age, and it is up to the early  childhood teacher to foster this growth.<br>
    Piaget  (Chang, 2006) believes that intelligence is the basic mechanism of ensuring  balance between the person and the environment. This is achieved through the  actions of the developing person on the world. The development of intelligence  is a continuous process of assimilation and accommodation that leads to  increasing expansion of the field of application of schemes, increasing  coordination between them, increasing interiorization and increasing  abstraction known to be reflecting abstraction. Piaget also believes that  intelligence develops in various ages and periodically changes qualitatively,  attaining increasing </p>
  <p>boarder  becoming more abstract and more equilibrated structures thereby  allowing access to different levels of  organization of the world. <br>
    In  addition, children primarily learn through imitation and play especially from  birth to four months. As the child continues to develop and mature, he  increases his growth in intelligence through visual and sensory development  until the child develops to draw insights to form mental representations. Thus the  child becomes to be creative over the span of time. Preschool children are  between 3 to 5 years old, they are very intuitive and curious. They ask so many  questions and they want to know why things behave the way they see or  experience them. Much of teachings depend on cognitive abilities that is  sharing information and observing signs that things shared are understood.  Applying Piaget&rsquo;s theory to Pre School learning, it is easy to say that the  Principles of Developmentally Appropriate Curriculum are very useful because it  takes on an unstructured system of learning enabling the learner to be more  creative and intuitive.  (Chang,  2006)      <br>
    In  2001, an act was passed known as &ldquo;No Child Left Behind&rdquo;, which made it a policy  to hold schools accountable for eliminating the persistent gaps in achievement  between different groups of children. With the aim of ensuring educational  equity, the law requires the reporting of scores disaggregated by student  group; that is, reported separately for the economically disadvantaged, major  racial and ethnic minorities, special education recipients and English language  learners. This in effect made all schools accountable for teaching all their  students effectively. However, majority of Americans support the movement&rsquo;s  stated goals, among them that all children should be achieving at high levels.  (National Association for the Education of Young Children, 2008). This public  support-for the goals if not the methods- can be viewed as a demand that  educators do something to improve student achievement and close the gaps that  all agree are damaging many future prospects and wasting their potential. As  early as 2007 more than three-quarters of the states had some sort of early  learning standards- that is, standards for the years before kindergarten- and  the remaining states had begun developing them. (NAEYC, 2008) Creating  improvements for preschool curriculum is a must. There is a need to be a strong  link between improving the cognitive development of the learner and the  improvement of the early childhood teachers&rsquo; preparation through continuous  training and research.  The curriculum is  a key element in their educational foundation, that if not adequately prepared  could result in the child falling behind developmentally.  A steady continuation of the child&rsquo;s  developmental growth can be assured by a good curriculum that is constantly  reviewed and aligned with the needs of the learner. This simply implies that a  diligent review of ECE curriculum is a must if we want the gap to narrow down <br>
    What then must be  done?  It is a must that educators  carefully assess the level of the learners, their needs and learn how to  differentiate the concepts and content to be introduced according to the  varying needs of the learner.  Educators  must implement Developmentally Appropriate Curriculum approaches to meet the  learning standards needed.  Further it  will be best to capitalize on the teachable moments, to fully engage them in  authentic, meaningful learning experiences.   Individualization is a key component of DAC to make sure that the needs  and interests of every child are focused on in a DAC environment (Bredecamp  &amp; Copple, 2007).<br>
    The objective of  the study is to assess the extent of the implementation of developmentally  appropriate curriculum in the preparatory level in the eight schools in the  Diocese of Novaliches as an aid in enhancing the curriculum in the Diocese.</p>
  <p>FRAMEWORK</p>
  <p>This study is  anchored on the theory of constructivism which assumes that the learners  construct their own knowledge based on interactions with their environment that  challenge their thinking. Developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) is based  on cognitive learning theories, rooted in the work of Piaget and Vygotsky,  which are guided by the premise that development refers to cognitive patterned  changes over time. (Abu-Jhaber, Al-Shawareb, and Gheith, 2010)<br>
    According to Oakes  and Caruso (Abu-Jhaber, Al Shawareb, and Gheith, 2010) DAP curricula focus on  the overall development of the whole child including language, cognitive, personal,  socio-emotional, and motor. Developmentally appropriate practices are  individually, age group and culturally appropriate. These &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;  relate to the everyday reality of the individuals within group, as well as to  the learning community as a whole. DAP curricula are learner-generated and  learner-centered, yet teacher-framed. In other words the teacher is the one who  judges what is needed to meet the developmental and learning needs of children.  DAP curricula encourage problem-solving, critical thinking and intellectual  risk-taking, and engender dispositions of life-long learning. Assessment of  children in DAP environments is ongoing and continuous, and is done for the  purpose of preparing a conducive environment for children&rsquo;s development and for  building upon existing strengths.</p>

Conceptual Model of the Study</p>
  <p>Figure 1 presents  the conceptual model of the study in assessing the implementation of  developmentally appropriate curriculum in the preschool levels in the Diocese  of Novaliches in aid of curriculum enhancement.<br>
    The extent of implementation of the developmentally  appropriate activities and practices of the current curriculum was in the light  of the following domains: language competency, cognitive development, personal  development, socio-emotional development and motor development.<br>
    <strong>Language  competency</strong> refers to the linguistic development of the child in 4 inter-related skills:  Listening, Reading, Speaking and Writing. It also includes being able to  differentiate different sounds and responses accordingly. It includes being  able to express one&rsquo;s feelings and ideas. It also includes vocabulary building,  reading readiness, comprehension, giving opinion and writing thoughts and  expressions.<br>
    <strong>Cognitive  development</strong> is a field related to the growth and development of a learner&rsquo;s intelligence  which particularly pertains to the information processing of the things the  child encounters in his environment and the assimilation of what he encounters  with the adult or anyone who can provide him the stimulus needed in the process  of cognition.  <br>
    <strong>Personal  development</strong> encompasses activities that improve awareness and identity, development of  talents and potentials build human capabilities and facilitate employability,  self development. It also includes the development of other people through  informal or formal activities.<br>
    <strong>Socio-emotional  development</strong> would be the ability to initiate and maintain a secure relationship. During  this development a child must learn how to approach other children, how to  negotiate issues, how to take turns and how to communicate effectively.  Theorist Eric Erickson in his eight stage theory on emotional development says  that three of the eight stages are addressed in the early childhood stage as  follows: to trust others, to gain independence, to gain independence in a  socially acceptable ways.     <br>
    <strong>Motor  development</strong> includes the growth of muscular coordination in a child. It is marked by the  increase ability to use muscles. It is a process of growth whereby a child acquires  and masters the skills to be able to move their body. These are carried by a  combination of the brain, the nervous system and the muscles.<br>
    The gaps, strengths and  weaknesses of the present curriculum in the light of the developmental domains  as well as the issues and problems encountered in the implementation of DAC  were assessed in aid of developing a program that will enhance the curriculum  of the Diocese.</p>
  <p><strong>OBJECTIVES  OF THE STUDY</strong><br>
    The main objective of this  study is to assess the implementation of DAC in the eight member schools of the  Diocese of Novaliches in aid of curriculum enhancement in the preparatory  level. <br>
    Specifically, it aims to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assess  the extent of  implementation of  DAC in the eight  member schools of the Diocese of</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Novaliches in terms of the  following domains: </p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Language competency; </li>
      <li>Cognitive Development; </li>
      <li>Personal development; </li>
      <li>Social- emotional development; and</li>
      <li>Motor development</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>2. Identify the gaps,  strengths and weaknesses of the present curriculum in the light of the  developmental domains?<br>
    3. Evaluate issues and  problems encountered in the implementation of DAC?<br>
    4. Develop an enhancement  program that may be proposed to come up with a developmentally appropriate  curriculum in the Diocese?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>MATERIALS  AND METHODS</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Methods  and Techniques Used</strong>. This study used the descriptive survey type of research  because according to Beck et al (2007), this method is concerned with the  description of the present situation, current practices, characteristics of  groups of individuals as well as their behavioral patterns, attitudes, and  opinions.   The analysis of the present  conditions may lead to the identification of weakness or problems for which the  researcher sought solutions. Thus, a descriptive study may result in a proposal  program or plan of action to solve a particular problem.<br>
    A validated semi- structured  questionnaire was used as a primary data gathering tool. The extent to which  Developmentally Appropriate Curriculum (DAC) is being implemented in the eight  schools in the Diocese of Novaliches was identified in the light of the  following domains of the curriculum namely, language competency, cognitive  development, personal development, socio-emotional development, and motor  development.</p>
  <p><strong>Respondents  of the Study. </strong>The  respondents of the study were all the 23 teachers and eight administrators in  the preparatory level in eight schools in the Diocese of Novaliches. Table 1  shows that the 23 teachers were from Blessed Sacrament Catholic School (4),  Colegio San Bartrolome Catholic School (3), Good Shepherd Catholic School (3),  Ina ng Buhay Catholic School (2), Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School (3),  Resurrection Catholic School (2), St. Francis Xavier Catholic School (3), and  San Isidro Labrador Catholic School (3), respectively.</p>

  <p><strong>Instrument  of the Study</strong>.  The instrument was constructed by the researcher guided by the National  Association for the Education of Young Children (2008) and research literature  on developmentally appropriate curriculum. The instrument used was composed of  two parts. The first part elicited information on the appropriateness of the  different activities of the current curriculum in terms of language competency,  cognitive development, personal development, socio-emotional development, and  motor development. Part two of the instrument assessed the issues and problems  encountered in the implementation of Developmentally Appropriate Practices. <br>
    After the  instrument was approved and validated, a pilot testing was done among  pre-school teachers who were not included in the study, to determine whether  they would understand them the way the researcher means them. The teachers were  asked to identify words or items in the questionnaire that are ambiguous or  hard to understand. Essentially, the contents of the instrument were very well  understood by the teachers. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Data  Processing and Statistical Treatment</strong> <br>
    The data collected were  tabulated and processed using Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences  (SPSS). In order to analyze and interpret the data gathered, the following  statistical measures were used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The extent of implementation of DAC in  the eight member schools in the Diocese of Novaliches was quantified using the  following scale:</li>

  <p><strong>The  Extent of Implementation of Developmentally Appropriate Curriculum </strong></p>
  <p>Developmentally appropriate practice(DAP) is a framework of  principles and guidelines for best practice in the care and education of young  children, from birth through age eight. It is grounded both in the research on  how young children develop and learn and in what is known about education  effectiveness. The principles and guidelines outline practice that promotes  young children's optimallearning and development (NAEYC, 2008).  The implementation of developmentally appropriate practices (DAP) in the  pre-school level in the Diocese of Novaliches was assessed in terms of language  competency, cognitive development, personal development, socio-emotional  development, and motor development.</p>
  <p>A summary of data  on the extent of implementation of DAC practices in the Preparatory level in  the Diocese of Novaliches is presented in Table 2. Analysis of data revealed  that the extent of implementation of language competency, cognitive development,  and personal development was to a great extent. This means that DAC  implementation was moderately extensive and functioning very well.<br>
    On the other hand, the extent  of implementation of developmentally appropriate practices in promoting pupils&rsquo;  motor development was to a moderate extent. This means that DAC implementation  was adequate and functioning well. According to NAEYC (2008), physical  education and movement programs for young children should be serious in concen­trating  on the development of physical skills. These skills are invaluable lifetime  tools that children and adults use to successfully partici­pate in regular  physical activity and to help maintain health and fitness.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Table 2<br>
    <em>Overall  Assessment of the Implementation of DAC Practices in Preparatory Level </em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Research in child  development shows that all children develop in a sequential, predictable  manner. While all children develop at their own rate, they tend to reach  milestones in a predictable pattern. Observing and documenting the physical,  emotional, and cognitive development of each child in your care will ensure  that you are providing the best learning environment possible. Implementing  developmentally appropriate activities and using intentional teaching  techniques will help the teachers understand how best to serve the children and  families in the classroom. By providing an active learning environment,  teachers help children make decisions, solve conflicts, and develop a sense of  community. While the teachers are the sole decision makers in a developmentally  appropriate classroom, they must be sure to take into account the individual  learning styles of the children in their care, as well as any social or family  concerns. (Novick, 2003).<br>
    According to the  NAEYC position statement, DAP programs have &ldquo;comprehensive, effective  curriculum that targets the identified goals, including all those foundational  for later learning and school success. In a DAP classroom, children observe and  participate in their community and develop constructive relationships with  others; they collaborate and talk with peers and adults; they cooperate to  solve problems. Teachers help children develop a sense of responsibility and  self-regulation; they acknowledge children&rsquo;s feelings and model skills for  resolving conflicts with others. Additionally, &ldquo;teachers plan curriculum  experiences that integrate children&rsquo;s learning <em>within </em>and <em>across </em>the  domains (physical, social, emotional, cognitive) and the disciplines (including  language, literacy, mathematics, social studies, science, art, music, physical  education, and health).<br>
    Needless to say,  establishing positive relationships with adults and other children is critical  to children&rsquo;s cognitive, creative, and physical and social development.  Teachers must establish authentic relationships with children, playing as  partners and having genuine conversations with them, much as they would with  another adult. Children sense this respect from adults and, in turn, extend  this same kind of respect in their interactions with other adults and children.  Of course, building relationships and a classroom community takes time. Thus,  teachers maintain a consistent group of adults and children that children  relate to on a daily basis. One adult typically meets with the same group of children  for planning and recall and small-group time. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Gaps,  Strengths and Weaknesses of the Present Curriculum</strong></p>
  <p>It was once believed that  children were simply new people that only lacked the knowledge of adults in  order to be mature and wise. If this were really true, education would simply  be the passing down of knowledge from one generation to the next. Now we  understand that people think and reason differently during different stages of  their lives. The way a child of three thinks is qualitatively different than  the way a child of fifteen does. Further, as has been stated by Piaget, the  stages that people pass through are followed in a sequential order, with none  of the stages being skipped or followed in a different order. Children from  birth through eleven or more years of age go through four cognitive stages.  Basically these stages show that the way children learn and make sense of the  world changes from concrete manipulation to abstract manipulation of objects  and information as they move through these stages. Hence, the implementation of  DAC in the Preparatory level is very important in developing the many aspects  of pupils. By identifying the gaps, strengths, and weaknesses of the DAC  implementation, a sound and logical enhancement program can be realized. <br>
    The identified gaps,  strengths, and weaknesses of the DAC implementation in promoting language  competency, cognitive development, personal development, socio-emotional  development and motor development were presented in Tables 22-26<br>
    <strong>Language  Competency. </strong>In  terms of language competency, encouraging the pupils to raise their hands if  they know the answer was identified to be the primary strength of the current  curriculum. This was followed by giving simple directions in English, using a  routine exercise each day to involve pupils in speaking, praising pupils for  their accomplishments, and encouraging the pupils to say polite words.<br>
    Meanwhile, there are areas that can still be improved  in terms of having activities where pupils speak into a tape recorder, and they  listen to their voice, ensuring the availability of television, computers, CD&rsquo;s  about the environment and plants inside the classroom.<br>
    <strong>                </strong>NAEYC (2008) suggested that  in order to sustain an individual child&rsquo;s effort or engagement in purposeful activities,  teachers select from a range of strategies, including but not limited to  modeling, demonstrating specific skills, and providing information, focused  attention, physical proximity, verbal encouragement, reinforcement and other  behavioral procedures, as well as additional structure and modification of  equipment or schedules as needed.<br>
    A cornerstone of  developmentally appropriate teaching is intentionality.  Teaching that meets learners where they are and that helps them to reach  challenging and achievable goals does not happen by chance. In everything good  teachers do—from setting up the classroom to assessing children to planning the  curriculum—must be intentional. They are purposeful and thoughtful about the  actions they take, and they base their actions on the outcomes the program is  trying to help children reach. The intentional teacher is guided by those  outcomes even in responding to unexpected opportunities—&rdquo;teachable moments&rdquo;.</p>
  <p><strong>Cognitive  Development:</strong> The  following strengths of DAC implementation were identified in terms promoting  cognitive development namely: respecting individual differences of the pupils,  accompanying pupils to educational field trips, providing material for counting  activities, ensuring the availability of pictures of objects associated with  each letter of the alphabet, and providing chart of letters of the alphabet  displayed inside the classroom.<br>
    <strong>                </strong>The gaps and weaknesses of  the current DAC implementation were making an aquarium available inside the  classroom with fishes which pupils can fees, exposing pupils to the use of  microscopes, binoculars to see small, distant objects, exposing the pupils to a  garden plot where they can plant vegetables and harvest them in time, asking  pupils to make their terrarium, ensuring the availability of a garden plot  where pupils can plant.<br>
    Because people think qualitatively  different at different stages of their development, learning activities need to  match the way each child successfully gains understanding and makes  connections. In order for the pupils to be actively engaged with their  learning, the educator should assess their cognitive levels and determine their  strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  <p><strong>Personal  Development:</strong> Praising  and reinforcing pupils to recognize their worth for a job well done was the  emerging strength of DAC implementation to promote personal development. This  was immediately followed by ensuring that trash cans are available inside the  classroom where pupils can deposit their trash, making pupils bring in their  pockets their own clean hanky to use, following a planned time schedule, and  ensuring the availability of cabinets where pupils can put and keep their  personal belongings which they can easily identify.<br>
    Other activities that need  further improvement are making certain that the different kinds of costumes of  community helpers are available inside the classroom, preparing an area where  teacher hands over different kinds of costumes or accessories for your pupils  to use when dressing up, ensuring the availability of full-body size mirror,  lavatory, and reminding pupils for their overly dangerous behavior.<br>
    The sensory materials such as dresses, full size body mirror, accessories and  the like are vital in promoting the personal development of children.  Hence, the schools of the Diocese of Novaliches may consider the following  characteristics of materials as suggested by Reynold et al (2002) for personal  development:</p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Control of error. </em>Materials are designed so  that children can see whether they make a mistake; for example, a child who  does not build the blocks of the pink tower in their proper order does not  achieve a tower effect.</li>
      <li><em>Isolation of a single quality. </em>Materials are designed so  that other variables are held constant except for the isolated quality or  qualities. Therefore, all blocks of the pink tower are pink because size, not  color, is the isolated quality.</li>
      <li><em>Active involvement. </em>Materials encourage active  involvement rather than the more passive process of looking.</li>
      <li><em>Attractiveness. </em>Materials are attractive,  with colors and proportions that appeal to children. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Socio-emotional  Development:</strong> Praises  and reinforcement of pupils to recognize their worth their accomplishments are  consistently being implemented in order to promote the socio-emotional  development of preparatory pupils. Other identified strengths of the current  DAC implementation were displaying happiness with their own accomplishments,  encouraging pupils to play together with other classmates, encouraging pupils  to volunteer in any class activity, and encouraging pupils to clap their hands  to show appreciation for work done by other classmates.<br>
    The schools may  consider the following gaps and weaknesses in improving their curriculum:  provision of an area where pupils can be by themselves if in case they are not  yet ready to join the other children for the given activity, provision of an  area where pupils can be by themselves if in case they are not yet ready to  join the other children for the given activity, provision of area where pupils  can &quot;Pretend Play&quot; with other children, and encourages parallel play.<br>
    Research  demonstrates the importance of socio-dramatic play as a tool for learning  curriculum content with 3- through 6-year old children. When teachers provide a  thematic organization for play; offer appropriate props, space, and time; and  become involved in the play by extending and elaborating on children&rsquo;s ideas,  children&rsquo;s language and literacy skills can be enhanced. (Bredekamp and Copple,  2009)<strong></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Motor  Development: </strong>It  was found out that enjoying action songs that use finger and hand movements was  very much implemented in order to promote motor development. Other identified  strengths were helping or assisting children with their task, involving pupils  in exercise and sports activities and providing small motor activities, and  providing time to play with other pupils.<br>
    On the other hand, the identified gaps and weaknesses  were having threading and sewing activities, punishing, scolding, and putting  to shame pupils who figure in accidents inside the classroom, availability of  sand area inside the classroom, have balancing on a low, wide beam for outdoor  exercises, have balancing on a low, wide beam, and availability of water area  inside the classroom.<strong></strong></p>
  <p><strong>                </strong>Developmentally appropriate  practice can be hard to spot by the untrained eye. Developmentally appropriate  practice can best be observed when there is an active learning environment. In  active learning, children come to understand concepts by playing,  hypothesizing, experimenting, and doing. Most activities in a developmentally  appropriate preschool classroom are not teacher directed. The projects and  activities are set up based on individual children's needs, and take into  account each child's strengths and weaknesses, developmental level and  interests. <br>
    There is a delicate balance  of teacher directed and child centered activities, with minimal time spent in  teacher directed activities such as circle time. Children are not required to  sit still and absorb information for long periods of time without being active  participants in the activity. Developmentally appropriate environments take  advantage of teachable moments and capitalize on intentional  teaching techniques. Children are encouraged to interact with materials in  their environment, as well as with teachers and peers. The identified gaps and  weaknesses in the implementation of DAC in the Diocese of Novaliches can become  a springboard in enhancing the curriculum, activities, and physical set up of  the school in order to provide quality and meaningful developmentally  appropriate practices among preparatory pupils.<strong></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Issues  and Problems Encountered in the Implementation of DAC</strong></p>
  <p>                A child-centered program is one in which educators  first strive to meet student needs. The antithesis of this would be a  curriculum-centered approach which places the mastering of predetermined  curriculum goals over that of meeting student needs. In order for a child to be  successful, they need to meet the needs of their own developmental tasks. As  they do this, they will be grounded and ready to be engaged by a  developmentally appropriate academic curriculum.<br>
    According to NAEYC (2008),  the world of early care and edu­cation stands to gain in some respects from a  closer relationship with the K–12 system. Given the shortage of affordable,  high-quality programs for children under 5 and the low compensation for those  staff, advocates see potential benefits to having more 4-year-olds, and perhaps  even 3-year-olds, receive services in publicly funded schooling. It is for this  reason that the issues and problems encountered by the schools in the Diocese  of Novaliches in the implementation of DAC in the preparatory level were  evaluated.</p>
  <p>The top five  issues and problems that schools have been encountering were as follows: the  Pre School Department is not given as much attention as the Elementary and High  School Levels in terms of curricular review, facilities and materials and  Faculty Development (1st), majority of the Faculty Members are not  ECE graduates (2nd), schools of the Diocese of Novaliches are not  all set up according to DAP because of limited funds (3rd),  uniformity of practices of the implementation of developmentally appropriate  curriculum needs to be emphasized in the diocesan educational system (4.5th),  and the evaluation system is not truly ready to conform to DAP system (4.5th).<br>
    This means that  the schools in the Diocese of Novaliches can still study the possibility of  improving their ECE curriculum especially in the preparatory level. This  situation is not only happening in the Philippines. The United Nations  International Children&rsquo;s Emergency Fund or UNICEF (Abu-Jaber et. al, 2010)  explicitly pointed out the poor conditions in most kindergartens in Jordan, as  well as lack of in-service and personnel training in the implementation of  early childhood education. Education provided at these kindergartens mainly  centered around academic development, with little emphasis on other developmental  areas.<br>
    In accordance with the NAEYC (2008), some of the  standard implementation is inadequate, inappropriate, or incomprehensive.  Hence, the UNESCO (2006) has recommended the following initiatives and  recommendations for DAC implementation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prepare an interactive curriculum  that has been evaluated and modified  accordingly;</li>
    <li>Prepare the general early childhood curriculum and its  outputs;</li>
    <li>Develop a criteria and conditions for evaluating an ECE  program;</li>
    <li>Train all teachers on the interactive curriculum and on the  working program with young children;</li>
    <li>Coordinate with Philippine universities to have early  childhood education majors in order to empower teachers academically; and</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Work on expanding the  programs and projects that relate to each childhood education. </p>

  <p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
  <p>                Based  on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were drawn:<br>
    1. It is imperative that teachers incorporate a wide variety of  experiences, materials and equipment, and teaching strategies in implementing  the developmentally appropriate curriculum to accommodate a broad range of  children&rsquo;s individual differences in prior experiences, maturation rates,  styles of learning, needs, and interests.<br>
    2. The identified gaps and weaknesses in the implementation of DAC  in the Diocese of Novaliches can become a springboard in enhancing the  curriculum, activities, and physical set up of the school in order to provide  quality and meaningful developmentally appropriate practices among preparatory  pupils.<br>
    3. Though there is much strength identified in the implementation of  DAC, the schools in the Diocese of Novaliches cannot  fully realize its successful implementation not unless the vital issues and  problems have been addressed.<br>
    4. An enhancement program is proposed by the researcher to further  improve the implementation of the program in the Diocese of Novaliches.</p>
  <p><strong>RECOMMENDATIONS</strong><br>
    Based on the findings and conclusions stated, the following are the  recommendations of the study.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>That the schools in the Diocese of  Novaliches continuously monitor and evaluate the extent of implementation of  DAC, most especially in promoting motor development to ensure that the  curriculum, activities, materials and physical set-up are in accord with the  standards set by NAEYC.  Budget  allocation may be reviewed to address the infrastructure needs of DAC  implementation.</li>
    <li>That teachers consistently implement the  DAC practices that were found to be regularly implemented and improve the DAC  practices where implementation needs further strengthening.</li>
    <li>That the Diocese of Novaliches may  consider the following advocacies of UNESCO for better DAC implementation:</li>
    <li>Prepare an interactive  curriculum  that has been evaluated and  modified accordingly;</li>
    <li>Prepare the general early  childhood curriculum and its outputs;</li>
    <li>Develop a criteria and  conditions for evaluating an ECE program;</li>
    <li>Train all teachers on the  interactive curriculum and on the working program with young children;</li>
    <li>Coordinate with Philippine  universities to have early childhood education majors in order to empower  teachers academically; and</li>
    <li>Work on expanding the programs  and projects that relate to each childhood education</li>
    <li>That the proposed enhancement program  for the Diocese of Novaliches be adopted and implemented to help improve the  implementation of the program.</li>
