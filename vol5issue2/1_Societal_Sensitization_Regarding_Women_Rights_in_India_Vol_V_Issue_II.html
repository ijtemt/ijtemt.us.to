Paper Title :<br>Societal Sensitization Regarding Women Rights in India<br>
What More to be Done?
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper presents a systematic and wide-ranging agenda with applicable tools, to study women’s situation and measures to sensitize the society regarding their human rights We have challenges to the rights-based approach as it is inherent in structure of international human rights law by way of, it addresses mainly relations between the individual and the State and its agents, rather than relations among individuals. A second challenge lies in the fact that realization of various equally valid rights inevitably creates situations of conflicts between them. Through the State's obligation to protect individuals against infringement of their rights by other individuals or non-State actors, the State is responsible for putting in place effective forms of prevention of violations and/or for holding non-State actors accountable for violations of other individuals' rights. But many violations of the rights of women occur in situations that remain outside the regulatory framework of the State. Examples include the family, or the existence of religious law, as well as traditional and customary law. Likewise, many economic activities performed predominantly by women are not regulated by the State. In this scenario the need to sensitize the society regarding women rights is an inevitable task. And in this contour this paper proposes some measures to sensitize women and other related agents, about their available rights, The need of the hour is the deep penetration, to the grass root level, with those various pertinent tools which can challenge the vulnerability of the women in that particular community or the society.

  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>Gender  is a social status. Equality and inequality is based on sex.&nbsp; Gender is a factor through which a human  being is recognized whether it is a male, female or another gender. Women are  often suppressed due to their gender identities and are in vulnerable positions  often. Every individual has multiple identities, which intersect with each  other and place individuals in position power and powerlessness at different  points. There may not be a static condition in the spectrum of &lsquo;powerfulness&rsquo; to  &lsquo;powerlessness&rsquo; at any given period of time. To work in the area of sensitizing  the particular group we have to understand their social identities. Social  identities are not homogenous and thus every identity has its unique role in  determining status in society. Social institutions like caste, class and sex  refers to the social identity of female and male human beings. It defines the  boundaries of what women and men can and should be and do. It shapes and  determines the behavior, roles, expectations and entitlements of women and men  in a particular society. <br>
    Socialization  teaches women and men to conform to rigid norms of gender. Cultural codes and  norms of behavior applied and reinforced with rewards and punishment. Training  for adult roles imparted through play, rewards system and educational  processes.(Bott, S., Guedes, A., Guezmes, A. and Claramunt, C., 2004). Gendered  stereotypes reinforced by moral precepts&nbsp;  Stereotypical expectations used as justification for limited life  choices Notions of &ldquo;Good&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; as yardsticks for social judgments The  Gender Box is created by the patriarchal social system. Patriarchy privileges  men and subordinates women. Patriarchal hierarchies are reflected in formal and  informal social structures and institutions (family, clan, community, market,  state). Patriarchal value systems sustain women&rsquo;s subordination by making it  seem Natural, glorifying it through moral arguments and by creating  institutions that replicate gender hierarchies.&nbsp;  Gender difference is made the reason for assigning different rights and  entitlements to men and women. It violates basic principles of equality and  social justice.&nbsp; It puts women at risk of  exploitation, oppression and deprivation. It prevents women from participating in  and benefiting from development interventions.&nbsp;  It prevents society from benefiting from the contributions of women. <br>
    While  human rights are often understood as the rights that everyone has by virtue of  their humanity, the assumption that all humans have the same experiences and  needs is particularly problematic for women. The ways in which women experience  human rights and human rights violations are unique. In India the present  scenario denies the historical specificity of women of ancient time, as  powerful or central. Yet, the Indian constitution provides safeguard for  women&rsquo;s rights and movements for women empowerment gave birth to some legal  provisions. (PoonamDhanda.2012). although with the perspective of globalization  and cultural interactions some legal provisions need to be amended or  implemented more carefully. We can have a look on the available safeguards of  the human rights of the women.</p>
  <h1>Available  Safegaurd of Human Rights of Women in India</h1>
  <p>God  exist there, where is regarded is the base of Indian society. Not only government,  or Parliament but many reformatory organizations have worked actively to  improve the position of women. BrahmoSamaj, AryaSamaj, PrathanaSamaj are  institutions that took the initiative to improve the position of India when it  was under British regime.

  <h2>Constitutional  Provision for the Betterment of Women</h2>
  <p>While  framing the constitution, special attention was given towards women  emancipation. The provisions in the chapters of directive principles of State  Policy and Fundamental Rights with regard to women welfare are the following:<br>
    <b><i>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provisions in the chapter for Fundamental  Rights</i></b>:&nbsp; <br>

    Article  243 T of constitution provides for the reservation of 33% of seats for women in  Municipalities</p>
  <h2>National  Commission for Women</h2>
  <p>In 1990,  the parliament enacted a law to safeguard the rights and legal entitlements of  women. Under this law National Commission for Women was established and this  commission came into existence on 31 January, 1992. It is concerned with all  those issues that are related with women&rsquo;s rights and upliftment of their  status. The commission emphasizes Parliament for the enactment of laws related  to the betterment of women. The commission inquires into the complaints lodged  by women in matters of cruelty, exploitation and torture. This commission works  for the social, economic and political rights of the women.</p>
  <h2>Educational  and Employment Programmes for Women</h2>
  <p>The  National Policy of Education was a landmark in the field of policy on woman  education. The Mahila Saniakhya Programme was launched in 1989 to improve women  literacy rate in those 163 district where women literacy percentage is low.  Government is trying to provide free education to girls. Many of the  kendriyaVidayalays provide free education to girls upto senior secondary level.<br>
    To  strengthen the economic status of women, the government has launched various  employment programmes such as Swaranjayanti, Gram SavarozgarYozana, IRDP,  Development of women and children in Rural area (DWCRA). Rashtriya Mahela Kosh  was set up in March 30, 1993 to provide credit to poor women. (Madhurima. 2010).</p>
  <h1>Efforts  Taken at Global Level for Women Empowerment</h1>
  <p>United  Nations Organization has taken various steps at global level to empower women.  It has created various organizations those work for women&rsquo;s upliftment and  development. These are as follows:<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United Nations development for Women  (UNIFEM) provides financial and technical help to women in developing  countries.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Research and Training  Institute for Advancement of Women (INSRAW) works for the improvement of the  condition of women.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Convention on the Elimination on all forms  of Discrimination Against Women (CADAW). It works to end the discrimination  against women.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee on Elimination of  Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). It monitors the implementation of the  conventions on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commission on the Status of Women &ndash; This  45 member commission was also appointed by ECOSOC in 1946. It is responsible  for the promotion of human rights of women in different countries, particularly  such matters as the empowerment of women, status of girl child, training cum  employment of women and their welfare programmes. In the year 2010, the UN has  decided to merge all bodies related to women in to single entity known as &ldquo;UN  Women&rdquo;.<br>
    Despite  the continued efforts to ensure compliance with human rights obligations and  the positive efforts, the situation of women and girls remains critical with a  persistent lack of accountability for continuous violations and impurity. Cases  of rape, harassment at workplace and dowry deaths are rampant. Illiteracy and  ignorance about their rights are still prevalent among a majority of the women.  Globalization and the liberalization of markets are transforming women&rsquo;s lives.  Yet women&rsquo;s perspectives and voices rarely inform the decision making processes  that shape the global economy. (Jalbert. E. Susanne.,2000).<br>
    We have  challenges to the rights-based approach as it is inherent in structure of  international human rights law by way of, it addresses mainly relations between  the individual and the State and its agents, rather than relations among  individuals. A second challenge lies in the fact that realization of various  equally valid rights inevitably creates situations of conflicts between them.  Through the State's obligation to protect individuals against infringement of  their rights by other individuals or non-State actors, the State is responsible  for putting in place effective forms of prevention of violations and/or for  holding non-State actors accountable for violations of other individuals'  rights. But many violations of the rights of women occur in situations that  remain outside the regulatory framework of the State. Examples include the  family, or the existence of religious law, as well as traditional and customary  law. Likewise, many economic activities performed predominantly by women are  not regulated by the State. Rights-based approaches are premised on strategies  for political consciousness and empowerment and ensure that people claim their  citizen rights and not fall prey to being beneficiaries (International Rescue  Committee and Family Health International, 2000). <br>
    Rights  &ndash;based approaches enable women to assert their rights and become key drivers of  their own development process. It enables a critical review of the dominant  social and political system and enables women to challenge inherent hierarchal  and patriarchal values. The goal is to enable women to access their meaningful  power, capacities and enhance capabilities that are needed to change their own  lives, improve their own communities and influence their own destinies. Deepen  conceptual understanding on Gender and Patriarchy and its interaction with  systems of social domination In this scenario the need to sensitize the society  regarding women rights is an inevitable task. Some major steps will be needed  to sensitize the community and the target groups i.e. women.<br>
    Exploring  how a gendered analysis can be integrated into the work and strengthen women&rsquo;s  access to rights with dignity. The research methodology used was predominantly  qualitative, using focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal and  interactive workshops. As one of the specific tool is &ldquo;Participatory Rural  Appraisal&rdquo;(PRA), a shortcut method of the data collection. It is a method of  action research and utilizes a range of techniques. It involves local people  and outsiders from different sectors and disciplines. Outsiders facilitate  local people in analyzing information, practicing critical self-awareness  taking responsibility and sharing their knowledge of life and plan to act in  suitable way. Building the capacity of the women group is the cornerstone of  any facility&rsquo;s ability to address violence against women and girls in an  ethical and effective way. (Shashi, Krishan. July 1, 2008)Methods for  collecting information on provider&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and practices  include surveys and gathering qualitative data through group discussions or  other participatory methods with providers. Qualitative data can provide an  in-depth understanding of provider&rsquo;s perspectives (United Nations Children&rsquo;s  Fund, 2010). Quantitative data makes it easier to measure change over time. <br>
    For this  purpose there should be a facilitator and the support staff who can go to the  fields, the actual grass root level. In general, facilitator should consider  the following key activities to build staff capacity: Facilitator from facility  administrators to service providers to support staff should first be sensitized  about issues related to violence against women and gender discrimination.  Evidence suggests that facilitators are as likely as any other members of  society to hold views that may be detrimental to the welfare of survivors, such  as blaming the victim. <br>
    Facilitators  also need to have a basic understanding of the nature and scope of violence  against women and girls, the dynamics of abuse, risk factors and consequences  (Bryce, P./PAHO, 2001).They should forget their personal perceptions, attitudes  and beliefs related to violence against women and girls and must be sensitize  themselves regarding these sensitive issues. They should be havingknowledge of  gender issues and human rights and must be incorporate with good understanding  of the legal framework, national policies and protocols. Their technical skills  related to addressing violence against women and girls ought to be appropriate.<br>
    Holding  intensive training workshops for staff, with the help of outside experts or  institutions; may enhance the capacity of facilitator and the support  staff(United Nations Department of public Information,  DPI/1772/HR&ndash;February1996).Sending selected staff to course or workshops in  other organization or universities and hiring new staff with specific expertise  in the area of violence against women and girls; and arranging for ongoing  training and support from individuals or organizations with specific expertise  in areas such as psychology or law can be the key players. Distributing written  educational information to providers on a regular basis and incorporating the  issue of violence against women and girls into other training workshops for  health staff will definitely pave the way for the desired out comes.<br>
    The  Other specific works can be done through PRA approach as follows:<br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Counseling<br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psycho-social Support for Survivors<br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gendered analysis of violence against  women <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crisis intervention techniques <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support group methods <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trauma, coping and survival <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current understandings of well-being and  social inclusion <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication skills and intervention  techniques <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The availability of state and community  resources <br>
    &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-discrimination and diversity <br>
    As  another major tool, Self Help Groups (SHG) may augment the sensitization of  women. They focus not only on savings but also provide a space for women to  access and learn about her rights. So the term can be backed with the other  term and that is SMG (Self Motivated Groups). However a deeper analysis is  needed to see how the loans taken by women are used for the purpose of  enhancing their position, dignity and that benefits accrue to her Vocational  training skills promote economic security among the community women but most of  them seem to be in the traditional domain and efforts are needed to challenge  such gender stereotyping and explore non-traditional skills&nbsp; Need to work with men in the community so they  could play positive role in ending and preventing violence against women and  girls. <br>
    The  emphasis of the Self Motivating Groups should be on ensuring that not only  should the material condition of women improves but also her position in the  family and the community; involving greater decision making powers, right to a  life free of violence and control over her bodily integrity and life, etc.  There is need to carefully examine what the SMG is focusing on: improving her  condition of health, education and other basic requirements. <br>
    The  other tool is &ldquo;Case conferences&rdquo; that are an opportunity for a service provider  to present to colleagues in a structured format any specific challenges that  the service provider may have experienced working with a particular survivor.  The goal of a case conference is to seek the professional insights and opinions  of colleagues, especially those colleagues with extensive experience or special  expertise.&nbsp; The famed and named  institutions should come forward in this direction to set an example in this  regard. Especially the educational institutions can arrange conferences and  seminars to sensitize the minded fellows so they can further create the  awareness to their peer groups and students.<br>
    Street  plays can play very effective role in sensitizing the common mass. It is an act  played by the trained actors to send particular message to the community. It  includes minimum eight to ten people to perform the act in the language of that  particular community, where the message has to be sent. The message is conveyed  in attractive form as singing, acting and dance can be involved. Street plays  can be organized by the educational institutes <br>
    The  critical and analytic perspectives of the present scenario&nbsp; signifies that when governments commit to the  realization of human rights principles, through legal reform as well as  practical implementation, discriminatory practices can be curtailed. However,  several challenges still exist in terms of the realization of women&rsquo;s human  rights and sensitization. The implementation of legislation poses difficulties  in the face of resource constraints and lack of gender-analysis in distribution  and prioritization. Securing women&rsquo;s human rights begins with ensuring the  sensitization of the community and the above mentioned tools can make this  target more achieving. This appropriate accountability mechanisms or tools will  ensure empowerment of women and improve their access to justice as more  awareness of the mass definitely sensitizes people regarding women situation in  society</p>
