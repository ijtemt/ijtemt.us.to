  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>The  Indian economy has seen a consistent growth in E-Commerce of 7-8% per annum in  recent years. Growth in the Internet over the last few decades has led to great  impact on communication and research in the institutes in India. Now the internet  can be accessed from anywhere around the world. Thus an E- Commerce site can  enter a global market space. Now E-Business can be conducted 24 x 7. Customers  in India can now buy whenever, whatever and from wherever they want. This has  increased choices. E-commerce enables fast delivery of on-line demanded  products. Via the internet, customers can receive more information about the  product and make a more informed decision. E-commerce has helped the business  concerns to cut costs. Present article aims to assess the future prospects of  E-Commerce in India, and its relevance by assessing the adoption level,  benefits experienced, negative outcomes and problems encountered due to  transacting the business through electronically.<br>
    E-Commerce  stands for electronic commerce and pertains to trading in goods and services  through the electronic medium, i.e. the Internet or phone. On the Internet, it  pertains to a website, which sells products or services directly from the site  using a shopping cart or shopping basket system and allows credit card  payments. E-Commerce often is defined narrowly to refer to using the Internet  to market and sell goods and services. E-Commerce is, however, much broader and  includes the electronic exchange of information, goods, services, and payments  and the creation and maintenance of web-based relations. E-Commerce may be  involved in the design, finance, production, marketing, inventory,  distribution, and service aspects of a business' activities. As such, the use  of e-commerce by a firm has the potential to both increase revenues from sales  as well as significantly decrease costs through greater efficiencies of  operation.<br>
    In  present scenario E-Commerce is playing very essential role in the online  business. Although it is one of the best &amp; cheapest intermediate for reaching  out to new customers in the online market, if E-commerce implemented  effectively, it also offers a smart way of doing online business &amp;  expanding it more. Today E-Commerce is a byword in Indian society and becoming  an integral part of our daily life. There are websites providing any number of  goods and services. Then there are those, which provide a specific product  along with its allied services. An online business E-Commerce podium is planned  and implemented to make the most of its reach to potential customers and  provide them with a convenient, satisfying &amp; protected shopping experience.  Traditional or brick-and-mortar businesses are primarily product-centric,  usually competing on the basis of product differentiation and innovation. In  contrast, E-businesses focus on customers and adopt a  customer-centric-approach. <br>
    In the  traditional way of doing business, companies manufactured products and  customers purchased them. But now customers are active participants in the  product design process; in fact, they often dictate terms to manufacturers and  decide the features of products. The increasing use of the electronic media to  conduct business and government transactions, and the increasing popularity of  the Internet among individual customers has forced organizations to digitize  their operations. Emerging e-business and mobile technologies and the greater  availability of broadband telecommunications have catalyzed their  transformation into e-enabled organizations.<br>
    The use  of high-speed Internet among communities and the proliferation of electronic  commerce among businesses create both opportunities and challenges for  businesses in small towns and rural areas. On the one hand, E-Commerce may  reduce many of the disadvantages associated with an isolated location by  decreasing marketing, communication, and information costs and increasing  access to lower cost suppliers and services. On the other hand, geographically  isolated businesses may find increased competition for their &quot;local&quot;  or &quot;traditional&quot; customers from nonlocal Internet businesses. <br>
    E-Commerce  activities generally are classified as business-to-business (B2B) or  business-to-consumer (B2C). Business-to-business E-Commerce refers using the  Internet to facilitate supply-chain operations and include electronic data  interchange (EDI), electronic funds transfer, electronic forms and messaging,  and shared databases. Business-to-consumer E-Commerce uses the Internet as a  retail market channel and in the case of information as a product or service  delivery channel.</p>

  <p>Most  businesses use E-commerce because it provides the opportunity for increased  profits (through higher sales or lower costs) and thus enhanced sustainability  of the firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  E-Commerce has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of  operations in all phases of the business' supply chain. E-commerce may benefit  a firm in product design, supply and inventory management, production,  marketing, sales and distribution, and customer service<br>
    &nbsp;Many businesses adopt an e-commerce business  plan because it provides the owner greater flexibility in terms of operating  location and hours. That is, e-commerce may present an individual with the  opportunity to be a &quot;lifestyle entrepreneur&quot; and locate the business  where the entrepreneur wants to live. For some individuals this enhanced  flexibility might result in a move, but in many cases E-Commerce permits  entrepreneurs to remain in place and benefit from proximity to family or other  local assets. <br>
    At  present, more and more small businesses are incorporating E-Commerce platforms  as part of their business systems. With the advent of the internet and smart  phones, it is now easier than ever to integrate a workable solution that will  work for many people. Here are just too many advantages for integrating an  E-Commerce system. Below are the main ones.</p>
  <h2>Enhanced  Turnover</h2>
  <p>Business  profits can be increased by increasing revenue through stronger sales or by  decreasing the costs associated with constant sales. According to reliable  statistics, there has been a tremendous increase in online sales over the last  couple of years. It is estimated that the revenue of a business that  incorporates an e-commerce platform can increase by twice. This is attributed  to the fact that most people prefer the ease of access and convenience that  comes with e-commerce platforms.</p>
  <h2>Increase  in Number of Customers and Customers Satisfaction</h2>
  <p>It is  clear that e-commerce brings in a lot of convenience in terms of payments. This  therefore automatically invites more customers and also impulse buyers. The  fact that the online payment system may accept different modes of payments  makes it easier for the small business to get customers of diverse backgrounds.  Customer service can be provided before the sale by making it easy for the  shopper to find what they want or after the sale in terms of addressing order  returns, repairs etc. The company website can be helpful in providing both  before- and after-sale service. Website provides services to potential  customers in the form of extensive information on product features, product  details and specifications, reviews by consumers, comparisons to alternative  products available, and accessories for the product. The company's website  contains thousands of pictures of tools and parts and accessories to assist the  customer after the sale. Via the internet, customers can receive more  information about the product and make a more informed decision. Greater  information leads to more confidence to make a purchase decision. More information  also leads to enhanced customer satisfaction because the customer has a better  idea about how to use the product. Further, e-commerce enables customization of  products so that customers can have a product that suits their exact needs</p>
  <h2>Better  Customer Relationship</h2>
  <p>For many  businesses dependent upon the tourism industry, an e-commerce site provides a  way to maintain and even strengthen customer relationships. For example,  e-mails notices to customers who have purchased artwork by particular artists whenever  new work by them is featured in the gallery. Linked with the shopping cart  feature of the site, this direct marketing touch allows customers to purchase  products beyond the tourist season and outside the region. Businesses can also  use the e-commerce features of their sites to emphasize customer service and  develop an edge over their competitors. Customers can plan every aspect of  their trip online, from routes to menus, and pre- and post-trip e-mails provide  customers with information about their trip.</p>
  <h2>Ability  to Conduct Business 24 x 7 </h2>
  <p>Many  businesses that do not use e-commerce may find it difficult to be open 24/7 due  to the multiple overheads that come with it in terms of staff and utility  payments. On the other hand, e-commerce makes it possible for a business to be  open and easily accessible round the clock without any increase in overheads.  Transactions and payments can continue being made automatically, without your  supervision. In case the small business deals in digital goods, the business  becomes totally automatic &ndash; full transactions, including purchase and delivery,  will automatically be carried out online. Unlike physical stores which have  opening and closing times, E-Commerce systems can operate all day every day.  Since the internet can be accessed by anyone from any where, time is no longer  a barrier to conduct business. People can interact with businesses at any hour  of the day that it is convenient to them, and because these interactions are  initiated by customers, the customers also provide a lot of the data for the  transaction that may otherwise need to be entered by business staff.</p>
  <h2>Fast  Processing of Transactions</h2>
  <p>E-Commerce  enables businesses to transact quickly. This takes away the problem that come  with other modes of payment that may require the merchant to wait up to one  month to access their payments. E-Commerce transactions clear in seconds and  merchants can either receive funds immediately or wait for only 2 or 3 days to  get the cash in their bank accounts.</p>
  <h2>Globalization  of Business</h2>
  <p>A  business operating purely offline may have challenges in reaching a wide scope  of customers. On the other hand E-Commerce has enabled local small businesses  to reach international masses. There are no limits to where the internet can  reach, therefore through e-commerce platforms, people can pay for goods and  services from literally any corner of the world. The internet can be accessed  from anywhere around the globe. Thus, an E-Commerce site can enter a global  market space. Further, unlike traditional communications methods, users are not  charged according to the distance over which they are communicating.</p>
  <h2>Facilitates  Quicker Collecgtion of Payment </h2>
  <p>In case  a service that requires recurring billing, it is easy to do so with an  e-commerce platform one can create his system in such a way that when a  customer makes a purchase, they can opt for their card to be re-billed at a  certain frequency. This makes it hassle-free for both. As long as one continue  using the service, their credit or debit cards will get charged at certain  intervals, increasing the predictability of income and eventually the bottom  line of a business.</p>
  <h2>Enables  Cost Reduction </h2>
  <p>E-commerce  enables a business to cut costs. Some of the costs that can be cut include a)  Cost of creating the product, b) Costs of processing orders from the customers,  c) Costs of handling customer phone calls, d) Cost of promotional material, e)  Costs of distribution f) Costs of sending out bill payment, g) Costs of  handling sales inquiries, h) Costs of determining product availability  (inventory management), i) Cost of marketing,&nbsp;  j) Human Resource costs, k) Costs of storing information l)  Telecommunication costs.</p>
  <h2>Improved  Supply Chain</h2>
  <p>The use  of internet can lead to a reduction in the inefficiencies relating to supply  chain. Some of the benefits are reduced inventories, reduced delivery delays  and efficient e-procurement. E-commerce also helps in building more  collaborative and stronger relationships with suppliers. This includes  streamlining and automating the underlying business processes, enabling areas  such as direct marketing, selling, customer services, fulfilment, procurement,  replenishment and information management.</p>
  <h2>Easde  of Access</h2>
  <p>This is  seen as one of the biggest advantages of e-commerce. Customers have access to a  host of services literally at the tip of their fingers. Customers can buy  whenever they want, from more locations. This increases choices. When customers  have more choices they can decide on a product with better features at a more  competitive price. Sometimes products are less expensive on-line.</p>
  <h2>Saves  Time and Effort</h2>
  <p>E-commerce  enables quicker delivery of on-line products such as software, games, music,  which can be downloaded. Quick delivery is important for people who want to use  the product immediately, as opposed to waiting longer. If they have to wait  long, they may pick a competitor's product.</p>
  <h1>Limitation  of E-Commerce</h1>
  <p>As  discussed above that the implementation of E-Commerce facilitates lot of  benefits but it also subject to the following limitations<br>
    i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Government initiatives are important in  the adoption of e-commerce and other ICT in general. They can be in terms of  promotion of ICT usage, education and the establishment of adequate regulatory  framework for e-commerce including taxation and tariff for revenue generated  through e-commerce.&nbsp; Government  initiatives are affected by many factors including the country&rsquo;s political  condition, economic condition, and external influence from other countries.<br>
    ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a country with an unstable political  condition, it is less likely that government will give enough attention, if  any, on e-commerce development.<br>
    iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GDP and income per capita are common  indicators for the economic condition of a country. Since e-commerce relies on  some technology infrastructures which are relatively expensive for many  developing countries, countries with unfavourable economic condition are not  likely to be involved in e-commerce.<br>
    iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E-commerce success relies heavily on a  number of technology infrastructures. Firstly, telecommunication  infrastructures are required to connect various regions and parties within a  country and across countries. The cost of accessing the infrastructures also  influences the growth of e-commerce. Its growth further requires the  establishment of reliable and secure payment infrastructures to avoid frauds  and other illegal actions. The overall technology infrastructure development of  a country relies heavily on the economic and geographical conditions of the  country.<br>
    v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The adoption of e-commerce also depends on  the cultural and social environment. In some countries, people consider  shopping as a recreation, and therefore, B2C e-commerce is difficult to  nurture. Likewise, the level of education, the availability of IT skills, the  level of penetration of personal computers and telephone within the society  affect the growth of e-commerce.<br>
    vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lack of awareness of the use and  potential benefits of ICT can also hinder the growth of e-commerce. In some  developing countries, many people are only aware of limited e-commerce  applications such as chat, email and browsing websites. As a result, many  organizations have not considered exploiting the potential of e-commerce to  improve their business operations.<br>
    vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The growth of e-commerce in a country is also  influenced by other countries. For example, the reputation of credit card  frauds in some countries caused blockages of several IP addresses by a number  of commercial sites from different countries. This situation can cause those  countries to be expelled from global business transactions and hence, limit the  usefulness of e-commerce</p>
  <h5>Conclusion</h5>
  <p>The  rapid growth of e-commerce reflects their potential benefits to businesses in  terms of increased sales, lower costs, and enhanced sustainability. E-Commerce  may permit retail businesses to &quot;cut out the middle man costs.&quot; Yet  many businesses are reluctant to develop e-commerce or they are disenchanted  with e-commerce because their experiences have fallen short of their  expectations. The bottom line here is that e-commerce is highly beneficial to  small businesses. It is significantly easy to set up and the benefits come in  almost instantly. Some of the things to be cautious of include poor security,  poor site design, too many refund requests, harsh terms and conditions of some  payment platforms and poor marketing. Once these areas are kept in check,  moving to E-commerce will be among the best business decisions for taking the  advantages of transacting business in the new technological environment.&nbsp; In most cases, e-commerce is considered  beneficial to the firm's profitability and sustainability. In general, the  benefits of e-commerce to the business are enhanced if the firm serves a niche  market, takes advantage of service providers (public and private) to maintain an  efficient and up-to-date e-commerce program, and integrates e-commerce into  multiple aspects of the business operation.</p>
