Paper Title :<br>The Role of Open and Distance Learning in Commerce Education: A Study of Uttarakhand Open University</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Distance learning caters to the educational needs of the target groups through the open system of learning and provides facility of study according to their own pace and convenience to the distant learner’s. Open and distance learning provides easy access to education to different sections of the society. Commerce education is one of the oldest branches of Indian higher education system. But nowadays commerce education is competing with new streams for its existence because these streams are based on the practical knowledge and application orientation. Commerce education is a living discipline and it is considered to be the backbone of business. The need of the hour is to make a corresponding change in the role of commerce education so that it becomes purposive and practical-oriented. Distance learning makes education open to many people irrespective of age, sex, religion, location, qualification and time, and it provides opportunities for working people to combine education and their work. It helps in developing education as a lifelong activity to enable persons to update their knowledge. In other words, it provides access to higher education for large segments of the population, and in particular, the disadvantaged groups like people living in remote and rural areas.<br><br>
Distance learning is an old idea with a new name. Its foundation goes back to the early 1700s when through correspondence students and instructors exchanged information through the postal system or other modes of communication. This paper attempts to study the importance of open and distance learning in imparting commerce education to the distance learners and its significance in making them independent in the present competitive world. This study also attempts to outline the opportunities which open and distance learning can provide to learners in India and especially in Uttarakhand for making them actively participate in stimulating socio-economic development of the country. This study aims at examining the role of Uttarakhand Open University in providing flexible, accessible, qualitative and cost-effective education to the distance learners so that they can contribute to a more sustainable and prosperous society.

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  Distance  education provides opportunity of learning to those, who do not have direct access  to face to face teaching. It also provides direct access of learning to the working  persons, house&#8208;wives and marginalized section of the  society. Distance education provides opportunity to working professionals to  update their knowledge, enabling them to switch over to new disciplines and  professions and enhancing their qualifications for career advancement. It helps  in exploiting the potential of Information and Communication Technology (ICT)  in the teaching and learning process. Open learning is a philosophy and  distance education is the mode used for translating it into reality. Both of  these are considered complementary to each other. Distance education is an  umbrella term which describes all the teaching learning arrangements in which  the learner and the teacher are separated by space and time. In fact it is a  mode of delivering education and instruction to learners who are not physically  present in a traditional setting of a classroom. Transaction of the curriculum  is effected by means of specially prepared materials (self-study (learning) materials)  which are delivered to the learners at their doorstep through various media  such as print, television, radio, satellite, audio/video tapes, CD-ROMs,  Internet and World Wide Web etc. Communication between the institution, teacher  and learners is mainly through electronic media and also through postal correspondence  and limited face to face contact sessions held at study centres that are set up  by the distance education institutions as close to the learners&rsquo; homes as  possible. The popularity of the open and distance learning is increasing day by  day because of its flexibility and learner friendly approach, particularly to  those who could not get access to the formal education system. <strong>(Fozdar and  Kumar, 2008)</strong><br>
  Open learning, which covers a wide range of innovations  and reforms in the educational sector that advocates flexibility to the learner  with regard to entry and exit; pace and place of study; method of study and  also the choice and combination of courses; assessment and course completion.  The open learning system aims to redress social or educational inequality and  to offer opportunities not provided by conventional colleges or universities. In  the system of open and distance learning, educational opportunities are planned  deliberately so that access to education is available to larger sections of the  society. Distance and open learning may also mean a more learner-centred  approach, allowing greater flexibility and choice of content as well as more  personal organization of the learning programme. (<strong>UNESCO, 2002</strong>)<br>
  <strong>Growth  of Open and Distance Learning System</strong><br>
  Distance  learning is an old idea with a new name. Its foundation goes back to the early  1700s when through correspondence students and instructors exchanged information  (assignments, notes, and tests) through the postal system or other modes of  transportation. <strong>(Harper, Chen&nbsp; &amp;  Yen, 2004) </strong>The growth of distance education has been exponential over the  last four decades in our country. With the establishment of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar  Open University, Hyderabad in 1982, a new chapter in the distance education  system began when full-fledged Open University with the mandate to provide  distance education was established in India. This was followed by the  establishment of Indira Gandhi National Open University in 1985. Five decades  ago policy-makers realized the imperative need of distance education in order  to expand the base of higher education. With the expanding base at the  elementary and secondary education levels, the demand for higher education had  increased. The University Grants Commission (UGC) suggested in its report for  1956-1960 that proposals for evening colleges, correspondence courses and award  of external degrees should be considered. The Planning Commission took serious  note of such a need and in its Third Five Year Plan mentioned the need for the  introduction of correspondence education in the country. <strong>(UGC, DEB)</strong> <strong> </strong><br>

  Table 1 exhibits that after independence there was only  one dual mode institute in the country but as far as single mode institutes are  concerned, there was no single mode open university in the country to impart  the higher education through open and distance mode of learning. Till 1982 there  was no single mode open university in the country. But in the year 2010 there  were 242 dual mode institutes and there were 14 single mode universities in the  country, which shows that conventional universities also realized the  importance of distance mode of education in imparting higher education to the  larger sections of the society. In the year 1975 there is remarkable increase  in the number of institutes providing education through open and distance mode.  In the year 2010, 115.13 percent increase in the number of institutions  imparting distance education has been recorded. The increasing number of  distance education institutes shows that distance mode of education has become  more popular among the larger sections of the society.<br>

  During the initial years the student enrolment increased  slowly from 1,112 students in 1962 to 29,500 students in 1970-71. It increased  during the next two decades to about 6 lakh in 1990-91. In 2000-01, there were  about 14 lakhs students studying through distance mode which further went up to  about 18 lakhs students in 2005-06. In the year 2009-10 there is remarkable  increase of 23.35 percent in the enrolment of the students studying through  distance mode. Thus, with fresh enrolment in open and distance learning programmes  at approximately 40 lakh annually, the share of distance education in the GER  is about 22-23%, which is significant. Therefore, it can be said that open and  distance learning can play important role in increasing the gross enrollment  (GER) of the country.<strong> </strong><br>

  Study the gender-wise distribution at various  levels reveals that male distance learners are more than the female learners  enrolled in different post graduate, undergraduate, PG Diploma programmes. But  in the case of certificate programme the difference between the male and female  distance learners is less, which shows that the both the male and female  learners have shown their equally interest in the certificate programmes. In  the year 2011-12 the total number of distance learners enrolled in various  progarmmes offered by the open and distance learning institutes is 34,26,237.  It has also been observed that in undergraduate programmes the enrollment of  students in both the cases is more than the enrollment of the students in the other  programmes.</p>

  Table- 4 shows the comparison between the  enrollment in the regular and distance learning system of education in the year  2011-12. In this year number of the students enrolled in research programme was  nil. But on the other hand, the number of the students enrolled in the post  graduate and under graduate degree progrmmes of distance mode of education were  more than the conventional mode of education. It shows that the degree  programmes are more popular among distance learner than the certificates and  diploma programmes. On the whole the percentage of the distance learners as  compared to the regular students is 154.46, which shows that distance  programmes are more popular than the regular courses of study.<br>
  <strong>Review of Literature</strong><br>
  <strong>Reddy  (2007), </strong>in  his study &ldquo;Revitalizing Commerce Education&rdquo; made an objective introspection about  the Commerce Education &ndash; its objectives, its problems, its job potential, its  quality and its relevance to the present day needs of our country. In this study he  emphasized on the re-designing of commerce education and suggested various  alternatives available for re-orientation of commerce education<strong>.&nbsp; </strong><br>
  <strong>Singh (2014), </strong>conducted a study on &ldquo;Commerce  Education in 21st Century: Prospectus and Challenges. The purpose of  the paper is to understand and review various issues that influencing and  related with commerce education.

In this paper they have reviewed the present  status of vocational education and training programmes in India. They have  examined the role of open and distance learning (ODL) system in providing  effective and dynamic vocational education and training in the country.

  <strong>Pulist,</strong> conducted a study on  &ldquo;Student Support Services in Correspondence/Distance Education in India: A  Historical Perspective&rdquo;. In the study author highlighted the necessity of Open  and Distance Learning in imparting quality higher education through optimum use  of technology. According to the author the student support services eventually  aim at compensating for the absence of live support from teacher for the  benefit of the isolated individual learners and making the necessaries basic  facilities available to them directly or indirectly.&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Srivastava (2002),</strong> in his study &ldquo;A  Comparative Study on Current Trends in Distance Education in Canada and India&rdquo;  highlighted that the formal system was unable to meet the demand for higher  education in India and distance education was adopted as an alternative mode at  the University stage in 1962. In both Canada and India distance education  opportunities at the university level have increased enormously. Many trends  are putting new pressures on the conventional education system, forcing many  institutions to review and amend their existing policies and procedures.<strong></strong><br>
  <strong>Need and Scope of the  Study</strong><br>
  Distance learning concept introduced in the  country with a view to democratize education, so that it covers large segments  of population, vocations and professions. The primary emphasis is on  innovation, flexibility and cost effectiveness. It aims at the dissemination of  learning and acquiring knowledge through distance education mode including the  use of any communication technology to provide opportunities for higher  education. Open and distance learning mode  of education has been recognized as one of the effective tools of educationally  empowering the sections of the society who could not afford to join the formal  on-campus education due to various reasons.&nbsp;  Presently, Open and Distance Learning institutions are not only  imparting education as an alternative to the formal system but also in areas  such as vocational and technical education and even in high technology based  education. The distance education also has potential to reach to the un-reached  and even marginalized and excluded groups such as tribal populations and women.<br>
  The main focus of the present study is to examine  the role of open and distance learning in imparting commerce education to the  distance learners. The universe of the present study is confined to Uttarakhand  Open University. The area of the study aims at examining the role of UOU in  providing flexible, accessible, qualitative and cost-effective education to the  distance learners, so that they can contribute to a more sustainable and  prosperous society.<strong> </strong><br>
  <strong>Objectives of the  Study</strong><br>
  In view of the above  discussion, the following objectives have been visualized for the present  study:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To study the role of open and distance learning in commerce  education.</li>
  <li>To pin point the challenges before distance mode of  learning.</li>
  <li>To suggest remedial measures for commerce education  through open and distance mode of learning. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Research Methodology</strong><br>
  The  present study has been conducted to examine the role of open and distance  learning in imparting commerce education to the distant learners. The data  required for the study is collected from secondary sources. In the light of  above objectives set forth the information has been collected from records of  Govt. of India, Govt. of Uttarakhand and Uttarakhand Open University. The  learner includes both rural and urban. The data drawn  from various sources has been analyzed with the help of mathematical test as  percentage etc.<strong></strong><br>
  <strong>Commerce  Education Through Open and Distance Learning</strong><br>
  Commerce  education is that area of education which develops the required knowledge,  skills and attitudes for the successful handling of trade, commerce and  industry. Commerce education can be expected to continually adopt to meet the  needs of people but as we encounter the challenges of the 21st century  and negotiate the complexities of the information age, their needs will only  become more and more demanding. <br>
  The  main objective of commerce education is to provide knowledge and skills related  to commerce related activities. In post independence period, the growing  phenomenon of globalization, liberalization and privatization has been  influencing the commerce education. Commerce has grown from a subject to a  multi-faceted discipline in most of the universities and had acquired a pride  of place amongst different academic disciplines.<br>

  Study the gender-wise status of commerce  education in India (2011-12) reveals that the number of the distance learners  enrolled in the post graduate degree programme (38.08 percent) is more than the  learners enrolled in graduate programme (14.05 percent). On the whole the  comparison of the regular students with the distance learners reveals that the  male students enrolled in distance mode is more than the female students, which  is 17.52 percent and 14.02 percent respectively. In other words, we can say  that male learners are more interested in the distance mode programmes as  compared to the female learners. It has been possible due to the limitations of  the formal system of education.<strong> </strong><br>

  It  has been observed from the above table that in the initial years there is a  declining trend in the enrollment of learners in various programmes offered by  the university. But in the 2010-11 there is remarkably increase in the strength  of the distance learners in Bachelor Degree as well as Diploma and Certificate  Programmes. In this academic session university launched various Master Degree  Programmes i.e. MBA, M.Com. MSW, M.A. in Education, History, Political Science  and Hindi etc. In the academic session 2013-14, there is again decline in the number  of the students in all the programmes except Bachelor Degree Programme. It is a matter of great concern and to achieve the target  of reach the unreached, university has to popularize and familiarize its  programmes among the distance learners of the state. University should launch more profession and job-oriented  programmes as per the need and requirements of the local aspirants. &nbsp;<br>

  Table-7  exhibits that in the academic sessions 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10, there is  decline in the number of the students enrolled in the Bachelor of Commerce Programme  offered by the university. In the year 2010-11, Master of Commerce programme  was offered by the university. As a result, there is remarkable increase of  1014.29 percent in the total number of the students enrolled in the M.Com. and  B. Com. Programmes of the university. It has also been found that in the  academic session 2013-14 there is a decline in the number of students enrolled  in M.Com. and B. Com. Programmes. To increase the  number of students in these programmes, there is need to update the  curriculum of commerce and linked it to the needs of day to day life of the  students. <br>
  Limitations  of the formal system of education were attracted policy makers towards  non-conventional modes of education for providing non-residential studies like  correspondence courses. Therefore, in order to insure access and education of a  reasonably good quality,&nbsp;we must think of some alternative system capable  of supplementing the role of conventional system, and distance education is one  of such alternatives. As a result, the distance  education mode was adopted by many universities to meet the ever-growing demand  of those students who lacked means to pursue higher education through the  regular stream.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion  and Suggestions</strong><br>
  Commerce  education is one of the oldest branches of Indian higher education system. It  is regarded as the base of many streams of education such as management,  accounting, insurance, banking, taxation, finance, marketing and business law  in India. But nowadays commerce education is competing with these new streams  for its existence, as these branches are following practical based or skill  oriented pedagogy. In other words, it is losing its sheen as compared to the  other practical based disciplines. Moreover, in the present scenario, due to  globalization and advancement of information technology, competitive  marketplace is emerging and education systems are changing. Distance  education is mode to provide an opportunity to those who left the study in  between and want to be part of the regular system and want to be part of the  learned society. The  main objective of distance education is to democratize higher  education to large segments of the population, in particular the disadvantaged  groups such as those living in remote and rural areas, working people, women  etc. It also develops education as a lifelong activity to enable persons to  update their knowledge or acquire knowledge in new areas. Open and distance learning occupies a special place in the  Indian higher education system because of its major contribution in enhancing  the gross enrollment ratio and democratization of higher education to large  segments of the Indian population particularly to reach out to the unreached  and to meet the demands of lifelong learning which has become more of a necessity  in the knowledge society.<br>
  Commerce education is facing multiple  challenges in the present scenario. As we know it is a living discipline and  needs to keep pace with the changes happening locally as well as globally. To  bring back the dignity and glory of commerce education as it had in the past, a  new orientation requires to be given to the discipline of commerce education.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There  is need to update the curriculum of commerce and linked it to the needs of day  to day life of the students or with the needs of the industry. </li>
  <li>There should be more focus on the practical aspects rather than  theoretical aspects. Computerized accounting has been introduced as compulsory  part of the course.</li>
  <li>Commerce curriculum needs revision and it should be design to  develop skills such as communication, decision making, problem solving,  leadership etc. Keeping in view the changes in business  environment, the syllabus needs to be redesigned at regular intervals. </li>
  <li>To update themselves with the ever-changing business  environment, there is need to encourage the faculties of colleges or  universities to participate in various training programs.</li>
  <li>The interaction with the industry and  linkages with the professional bodies and the recruitment agencies should be  encouraged. </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is the  need of the hour that more emphasis must be given to distance learning so that  the left out and those who enable to carry on their study through regular mode  of education can get a chance of learning through distance mode of education  and be a part of learned society. <br>
