Paper Title :<br>Child Rights in India<br>A Light on the Role of NHRC in Implementing Them</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper is related with the provisions for child rights which entail the constitutional law and other programmes for the welfare of children in India. Besides this it focuses on the prevailing problems of children in India and role of National Human Rights Commission. The study appreciate the role and working of NHRC with providing some suggestions on specific areas. It recognizes the challenge is to translate political commitment to practice and suggest that the development with social justice cannot be achieved in the absence of respect for human rights. There has to be an enabling environment - legal political, economic and social - sensitive in the local context for realization of right to development. The gap between intention and action has undermined the credibility of several schemes. NHRC targets to be a facilitator to trigger this process for the realization of the right to development.

  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>For full  development as human beings, exercise and enjoyment of Human Rights by all the  people is necessary. Human Rights and fundamental freedoms help us to develop  our intrinsic qualities, intelligence, talents and conscience to meet our  material and spiritual needs (Dr. Justice Shivaraj V. Patil, Acting  Chairperson, NHRC). It is pointless to state that without the gratitude of the  right to education, apprehension of the right to development of every human  being and nation is not possible. The knowledge of the rights and freedoms, of  oneself as much as of the others, is considered as a fundamental tool to  guarantee the respect of all human rights for each and every person. In this  scenario if we see child which seems to be more vulnerable, the state guarantee  few rights for welfare. But still some prevailing problems in the society make  us think for the loopholes or the back draws in the implementation of rights. Some  institution in this regard play important role by coming forward as a support  to the existing system. NHRC, National Human Rights Commission is one of them  in the arena of implementing and assisting existing system. This paper  highlights NHRC role and seek for some more hope in actualizing child rights.</p>
  <h1>Discussion</h1>
  <h2>Who  is a Child</h2>
  <p>Generally  a child is defined using age criterion. A &lsquo;child&rsquo; as a social being can however  not be defined merely through an age criterion. A universalistic way of  defining childhood may lead to developing a monolithic concept of childhood,  unrelated to social aspects. Childhood as &ldquo;a social construct varies over time  and space&rdquo; was never an unacceptable view. But laws have their own strengths  and limitations. A legal system, with State as an impartial institution,  requires a neutral standard to classify all persons into child and adult in  social system, will fail.</p>
  <h1>Rights  of Child</h1>
  <h2>UN  Declaration of the Rights of the Child</h2>
  <p>&bull; Non-discrimination.<br>
    &bull;  Special protection, opportunities and facilities to develop physically,  mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and normal manner and  in conditions of freedom and dignity.<br>
    &bull; The  right to a name and nationality.<br>
    &bull; The  right to social security, adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical  services.<br>
    &bull; The  differently-abled child to be given special treatment, education and care.<br>
    &bull; The  need for love and understanding so that the child grows in the care and  responsibility of his/her parents, and in an atmosphere of affection and moral  and material security.<br>
    &bull;  Entitlement to education, which should be free and compulsory, at least in the  elementary stages.<br>
    &bull; The  child should be among the first to receive protection and relief in all  circumstances.<br>
    &bull;  Protection against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation, including  that associated with employment.<br>
    &bull;  Protection from practices that may foster racial, religious and other forms of  discrimination.</p>

    <b>Some  highlights of Programmes for Children in India</b><br>
    Development  programmes in the country, including those for children, are carried out within  the framework of the Five-Year Plans. Some of these programmes are wholly  funded by the Central Government, some by both Central and State Governments,  and some entirely by the State Government, depending on whether the programmes  are classified as Central, centrally sponsored or State sector schemes. In  addition, a wide variety of programmes are also being implemented in  collaboration with international organizations and non-governmental  organizations, which are now growing as a vibrant sector in the development and  empowerment of children. <br>
    The  First Five-Year Plan (1951-56) Health, nutrition and education of children were  identified as special areas of concern. The Government of India passed the  Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and ratified the International Labour  Organization (ILO) Convention No. 5 of 1919 on minimum age of work in industry.<br>
    The  Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61) aimed at stabilising the child welfare system.  As such, the activities of CSWB were further strengthened. In 1956, the  Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act (SITA) was enacted in  pursuance of Government of India&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations  Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and the Exploitation  of the Prostitution of Others in the year 1950. Some of the other legislations  enacted in the year 1956 were the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, Hindu  Minority and Guardianship Act, Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Institutions (Licensing)  Act and Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act. <br>
    Third  Five-Year Plan (1961-66) with increased emphasis on intersectoral coordination  of services for children made an attempt for coordinating health, education and  welfare services.. The recommendations of the Kothari Commission led to the  formulation of the National Education Policy in 1968 which in a way gave fillip  to the efforts being made in the education sector. <br>
    The  Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-74) focused on development of a package of basic  minimum services for children. It also drew attention to the problems of  neglected and destitute children and introduced a Scheme for Children in Need for  Care and Protection. Right to health being a basic human right, the Fourth Plan <br>
    The  Fifth Five-Year Plan (1974-79) saw a shift in focus from child welfare to child  development wherein emphasis was laid on further integration and coordination  of services, increased allocations and introduction of new schemes for  children. The adoption of National Policy for Children led to the constitution  of the National Children&rsquo;s Board in December, 1974 under the president-ship of  the Prime Minister for planning, reviewing and coordination of services and  programmes to meet the needs of children.<br>
    The  Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980-85) reiterated the approach and strategy adopted for  children during the Fifth Plan and further promoted integration and  strengthening of child welfare and development programmes started earlier. The  problem of working children and their welfare simultaneously received attention  of the planners for the first time during the Sixth Five-Year Plan and  appropriate programmes were undertaken to improve the health, nutrition and  educational status of working children. <br>
    The  Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985-90) led to spatial expansion and enrichment of  child development services. In order to give focussed attention and direction  to child development, a separate Department of Women and Child Development was  set-up for the first time in the Ministry of Human Resource Development in  September 1985. Its status was elevated to that of an independent Ministry of  Women and Child Development in 2006 and issues concerning children that were  earlier being dealt by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment have now  been transferred to it. <br>
    The  focus in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1992-97) was on human development through  advocacy, mobilisation and community empowerment and it accorded high priority  to survival and development of children.&nbsp;  The Eighth Plan specifically recognised the &lsquo;Girl Child&rsquo; as an important  target group, demanding attention of the Government for her development and to  fight against the prevailing gender discrimination. <br>
    In the  Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002), efforts were made to expedite effective  implementation and achievement of the goals set in the two Plans of Action  besides instituting a National Charter for Children to ensure that no child remains  illiterate, hungry or lacks medical care. <br>
    In Tenth  Five-Year Plan (2002 &ndash; 2007), overall emphasis has been on a rights-based  approach with regard to &lsquo;survival, development and protection&rsquo; of children.  Accordingly, focussed attention is being given to arrest the problem of  declining sex ratio including its offshoots &ndash; female foeticide and female  infanticide. Special efforts are being made to ensure effective enforcement of  related legislations to prevent and eradicate the problem of female foeticide and  female infanticide. <br>
    In  Eleventh and ongoing twelfth Five-Year(2007-2012 &amp;2012-2017)too worked on  the same lines.<br>
    With  regard to education, the Constitution (86th Amendment) Act was notified in  December 2002, making free and compulsory education a Fundamental Right for all  children in the age group of 6-14 years. The fact that Article 21A was added to  the Constitution for recognising right to primary education implies that right  to personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 is now also the basis for a general  right to education. Correspondingly, Article 45 of the Constitution has been  substituted so as to provide for early childhood care and education for all  children till they complete the age of 6 years. Article 51A was further  modified by adding a clause &ndash; (k) &ndash; stating that it is the duty of the parents/  guardians to provide opportunities for education to their children/ward between  the age of six and fourteen years. Ever since education became a Fundamental  Right, the Tenth Plan adopted a new approach towards achieving the goal of  Universalisation of Elementary Education (UEE).<br>
    <b>Supreme  Court and child right</b><br>
    From the  Seventh Five-Year Plan onwards, the judiciary and the Supreme Court too have  played an active role in upholding the rights of the child. The Supreme Court  of India has developed the concept of jurisdiction under which any individual  can approach the Court with regard to the violation of a fundamental right. The  Supreme Court has also modified traditional concepts by allowing groups of persons  or organizations to intervene in cases relating to violations of fundamental  rights even though they may not have been affected personally in the matter.  This concept of &lsquo;social action litigation&rsquo; in India represents an effort to use  the legal system to ensure action to realize constitutionally guaranteed  rights. Some of the most important examples of social action litigation for  children are the following cases, each of which has been a landmark in the  process of ensuring children&rsquo;s rights:<br>
    a)  Laxmikant Pandey vs. Union of India [AIR (1984) SC 469, AIR (1986) SC 276, AIR  (1987) SC 232] on Adoption of Children.<br>
    b)  Shiela Barse vs. Union of India [AIR (1986) SC 1883, AIR (1988) SC 2211] on  Trafficking of Children.<br>
    (c) M.C.  Mehta vs. State of Tamil Nadu [JT 1990 SC 263] on Problem of Child Labour.<br>
    (d)  Vishal Jeet vs. Union of India [1990 (3) SCC 318] on Problem of Child  Prostitution.<br>
    (e) Unni  Krishnan vs. State of Andhra Pradesh [1993 (1) SC 645] on Education of  Children.<br>
    (f)  Gaurav Jain vs. Union of India [1997 (8) SCC 114] on Problems of Prostitution  and Children forced into Prostitution.<br>
    (g) Gita  Hariharan vs. Reserve Bank of India [(1999) 2 SC 228] on Guardianship.<br>
    (h)  Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT) &amp; Others vs.<br>
    Union of  India &amp; Others [2000 SC 301].<br>
    In  accomplishing the milestones, both at the national and international level, the  non-governmental and civil society organizations have played an equally  important role along with the Government in virtually every aspect concerning  children. The media too has played a critical role in shaping public opinion  and creating mass awareness. The Government of India and UNICEF collaborative  initiatives over the years have focused on enhancing the capacities of the  electronic and print media personnel in the Ministry of Information and  Broadcasting so as to integrate and represent issues concerning children and  their rights effectively. As a result, the media is gradually focusing on  children&rsquo;s issues in a qualitative way. This is certainly a positive sign for  the future and it is hoped that the media will increase its responsibility to  include monitoring of child rights violations in a significant and persistent  manner.</p>
  <h1>Still  Prevailing Problems</h1>
  <h2>Vulnerability  of Child Population </h2>
  <p>From 548  million persons in 1971, the population of India crossed the billion mark  officially on 11 May 2000. The 2001 Census gives the total population for the  country as 1,028.7 million persons. This population is expected to reach 1,264  million in 2016 which means that approximately 236 million persons are likely  to be added to India&rsquo;s population in the current and ensuing decades. Such a  massive increase in numbers will, to a large extent, offset the gains of  economic development and require massive inputs for social services, civic  amenities and infrastructure development. The population of States constituting  the Indian Union varies considerably in size. Uttar Pradesh, the biggest State  has retained its position with a population of 166 million in 2001 even after a  separate State (Uttaranchal) was carved out of it in 2000. Some 18 States  (Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat, Orissa, Kerala, Assam, Punjab,  Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir), as per Census 2001,  had a population of more than 10 million, while two States (Himachal Pradesh  and Uttaranchal) had a population of more that 5 million but less than 10  million.<br>
    All this  indicates how critically important it is to improve the child development  profile in these States if the national aggregate of child development  indicators is to show a significant improvement. Currently, several States are  lagging behind on social as well as economic development indicators. This  situation needs to be looked into and tackled in a very concerted manner.</p>
  <h2>Adverse  Child Sex Ratio</h2>
  <p>The  child sex ratio is calculated as number of girls per 1,000 boys in the 0-6  years age group. In India, the 2001 Census reported a child sex ratio of 927  girls per 1,000 boys, which is definitely adverse to girls. The 1991 Census had  reported child sex ratio of 945 girls per 1,000 boys, which signifies that a  decade later, the child sex ratio has worsened further by 18 points. Prior to  the 1991 Census, this ratio had fallen from 976 in 1961, to 964 in 1971, and  962 in 1981. A stage may soon come when it would become extremely difficult, if  not impossible, to make up for the missing girls. The declining child sex ratio  has already started showing its ramifications in States like Punjab, Haryana,  Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh. In  States like Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat, this ratio has declined to less than  800 girls per 1,000 boys. The Government needs to recognize this  discrimination. Girls have a right to live just as boys do. Moreover, missing  numbers of each sex and the resulting imbalance, is bound to destroy the social  and human fabric.</p>
  <h2>Impact  of Poverty on Children </h2>
  <p>Poverty  exercises an adverse influence on the health and nutrition status of children.  Inadequate and irregular earnings affect the quantity and quality of food that  a family can consume throughout the year, its standard of living, and access  and use of healthcare. The extent of poverty varies considerably between  States. Removal of poverty is one of the central concerns of Indian planners  and its reduction a key indicator of success in implementation of policies and  programmes, including those relating to children.</p>
  <h2>Need  for a Uniform definition of Child</h2>
  <p>As  mentioned earlier, the Constitution of India and the laws enacted over the  years have some unique and far-reaching provisions to protect children. Yet,  there are laws in which the age of the child is not in consonance with the CRC,  which the Government ratified way back in 1992. Besides, the age of the child  has been defined differently in different laws. These different age-specifics  under different laws not only create a dilemma, but also set the stage for  injustice. This is because, whether the same human being is or is not a child  depends upon the law that is being invoked in a given case. Moreover, when the  laws are in conflict with one another due to diverse definitions, it is but  natural a difficult task to decide the &lsquo;best interests of the child&rsquo;. It is  thus necessary that the definition of the term &lsquo;child&rsquo; be brought in conformity  with the CRC, viz. &ldquo;below 18 years of age&rdquo;, by establishing one standard &lsquo;age  of majority&rsquo;.</p>
  <h2>Need  for Modifications in Other Constitutional and Legislative Provisions Related to  Children Education</h2>
  <p>The 86th  Amendment to the Constitution, on the Fundamental Right to Education for the 6  to 14 years age group, has also led to the inclusion of an additional clause  under article 51A that imposes a fundamental duty upon parents or guardians to  provide opportunities for education of their children/wards between the ages of  6 and 14 years. The amendment has provoked agitation and criticism from all  sections across the country. Their contention is that the State is abdicating  its responsibility for the provision of free and compulsory quality education  that must be accessible and appropriate, both socially as well as physically.  In effect, it is penalising the poor parents twice &ndash; for being poor and for  their inability to send their children to schools, the causes for which may be  beyond their control. Lack of quality, appropriate and accessible education is  one of the major reasons for children dropping-out of school. The other  reasons, of course, are poverty and to some extent the need for elder children  to look after their younger siblings. In the absence of a well-drawn plan to  ameliorate poverty and lack of alternative childcare facilities for children  who have been deliberately kept out in the amendment, the Government needs to rethink  and reconsider its stand.</p>
  <h2>Child  Marriage </h2>
  <p>There is  legal recognition of the fact that children must not be married before they are  physically and mentally ready for it. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929  (CMRA) prescribes a minimum age of 21 years for males and 18 years for females.  As the title of the Act suggests, it is merely a law to prevent the  solemnization of child marriages, but does not address the situation of a child  who has been married off before the law could prevent it. It does little to  protect children who have been married off, sometimes even before they can  stand on their feet. Efforts to amend the CMRA have been going on for almost  four years, yet there is no consensus on the issues on which amendments are  required.</p>
  <h2>Child  Labour</h2>
  <p>The  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was enacted in 1986, to  specifically address the situation of child labour. However, this law is  inadequate both in its understanding and the framework that it provides for  dealing with the problem of child labour. By distinguishing between hazardous  and nonhazardous forms of labour, and identifying certain processes and  occupations from which children are prohibited from working, it leaves out a  large range of activities that children are engaged in and thus continue to be  exploited and abused. The large-scale exploitation and abuse of children  employed in domestic work and hotels are cases in point. On August 1, 2006, the  Ministry of Labour added the following occupations to the list of hazardous  occupations: domestic servants, workers in dhabas, restaurants, hotels, motels,  tea shops, resorts, spas or other recreational centres. The notification for  this came into effect on 10 October 2006. This is a welcome step but far from  adequate. Bonded child labour and other extremely exploitative forms of child  labour including slavery, prostitution, drug trafficking, etc. are other grey  areas which require priority attention. The ILO Convention No. 182 on the Worst  Forms of Child Labour, which is currently being examined by the Government of  India from the point of view of its ratification, also seeks the immediate  elimination of these types of child labour.</p>
  <h2>&nbsp;Coercive State Population Policies and Their  Impact on Children</h2>
  <p>The  coercive laws based on the State Population Policies are also having a negative  impact on children. Since adults will now not be able to stand for elections in  some of the States if they have more than two children, some are choosing to  give away their &lsquo;excess&rsquo; children in adoption or disown them. The withdrawal of  facilities after the second child is bound to have an impact on the status and  value that the girl child in the family will have. It is a recipe for gender  discrimination and continuation of female foeticide.</p>
  <h2>Discrimination  Against Children </h2>
  <p>The  Government has adopted a policy of affirmative action towards addressing issues  of socially backward groups, such as the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and the Other  Backward Classes as well as the girl child. Despite these, discrimination &ndash;  overt and covert &ndash; occurs in various forms. The guiding principles underpinning  the Constitution of India are equality before law, equal protection to all and  non-discrimination. There is affinity between the standards set by the  Constitution and the standards set by Article 2 of the CRC. Equality is a  dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and therefore cannot be  confined within traditional limits. Articles 14, 15, 17, 25-28, 29 and 30 of  the Constitution aim to secure social and economic justice to all as well as  remove all kinds of biases. Yet, children born in the categories of Scheduled  Castes/Tribes and Backward Classes including religious minorities start life  with severe handicaps. Considering that these children account for a clear  majority of India&rsquo;s child population, it is necessary to look deeply into their  problems from all angles rather than paying a lip-sympathy to them.</p>
  <h2>Other  Policy Measures Requiring Attention </h2>
  <p>Adoption  of a New National Policy for Children India adopted a National Policy for  Children in 1974, declaring children to be the nation&rsquo;s most precious asset.  From 1974 till date, there has been a gradual shift in approach towards its  children from a needs-based to a rights based approach. However, India has yet  to translate this change into actual programming, which remains largely  &lsquo;welfare&rsquo; oriented. The fact that India is signatory to a plethora of  international/regional instruments concerning children, this needs to be  reflected in its National Policy for Children too. And, this could be carried  out only if the 1974 National Policy for Children is revised.</p>
  <h2>Child  Centred Planning </h2>
  <p>It has  also been found that so far as children are concerned, they have been devoid of  holistic child-centred planning that requires inter-departmental and  inter-ministerial coordination. As a consequence of this, policies and actions  concerning them have not brought out the desired result. The Ministry of Women  and Child Development is the Nodal Ministry responsible for all matters  concerning children. With the objective of strengthening central level  coordination, a National Coordinating Mechanism (NCM) was constituted way back  in January 2000 through an executive order issued by the Ministry of Women and  Child Development. However, the task of this NCM is perhaps restricted to  monitoring the implementation of the CRC only. It is not known whether the NCM  is still in operation after it met for the first time in September 2000.</p>
  <h2>Review  of Other Policies Impacting on Children </h2>
  <p>Correspondingly,  it is important to undertake an examination of all those policies which at the  outset may seem distantly remote but overall have an impact on the status of  children. For example, the agricultural policy or for that matter the forest  policy or the environmental policies. There is thus need to objectively gauge  the impact of such policies on children. There is ample evidence that there is  increase in malnutrition level among children due to change over from food  crops to cash crops as a result of the agriculture policies or the loss of  access to traditional sources of food and nutrients and livelihood of adults  due to the loss of access to forests because of the forest policy.</p>
  <h2>Struggle  for Child Survival</h2>
  <p>Right to  health is a basic human right that cascades from the right to life. The  Constitution of India under Article 21 makes right to life a Fundamental Right.  Health being a key factor in a nation&rsquo;s growth and development, it has been a  subject of national attention, public debate and Government intervention for  several decades. A number of national programmes have been launched in the past  to control and eradicate the major diseases. While there has been success in  some areas, in general, public health services have been characterized by poor  performance. The burden of disease has fallen disproportionately heavily on the  poor, the worst affected being children. Frequent episodes have not only caused  pain and suffering to children, but also affected their growth and development  and influenced performance in school. Here, it is important to remember that  child survival is not synonymous with child health, and that morbidity data are  also very important. Unfortunately, the collection of morbidity data is not  done systematically, particularly community based data. Also, due to the  absence of standardization in the presentation of data, making a comparison of  findings of different studies over time or across regions is often rendered  difficult </p>
  <p>The most  widely used indicator of child survival is infant mortality rate (IMR), which measures  the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births during the year. In India, as  per the latest Census, the IMR is still very high. Infant deaths (deaths below  age of one year) are indicative of wastage of human life.&nbsp; Malnutrition has been another major public  health problem in the country. It has somehow escaped public visibility despite  its harmful potential. In India, about half the children less than three years  of age were found by the National Family Health Survey 1998-9 to be  undernourished. The worst affected are the children of the rural and urban  poor. Today, the prevalence of severe under-nourishment has declined, but this  should not lead to any complacency. Malnutrition is often categorized as only a  medical problem, but it is the outcome of several factors &ndash; socio-cultural as  well as economic factors, and has important behavioral dimensions and,  therefore needs to be tackled cautiously through coordinated inter-sectoral  intervention strategies that are properly executed.</p>
  <h2>Children  in Especially Difficult Circumstances </h2>
  <p>In our  country today, there are a large number of children who are living in  especially difficult circumstances and require attention of all stakeholders.  Unfortunately, not much is known either of the nature of the problems faced by  these children or of the numbers involved. It was only as an aftermath of the  1990 World Summit for Children and the World Declaration on the Survival,  Protection and Development of Children to which India is a signatory, the  Government of India through its National Plan of Action, for the first time,  not only made a direct reference about this group of children but  simultaneously devoted an exclusive section on them. </p>
  <h2>Role  of National Human Rights Commission in Protecting and Promoting Children&rsquo;s Rights</h2>
  <p>The  &lsquo;rights of children&rsquo;, is one area on which the National Human Rights Commission  (NHRC) has tried to focus continuously ever since it was constituted in October  1993. It observed from the very beginning that despite there being major  provisions in the Constitution of India for survival, development and  protection of children as well as laws to safeguard their interests including  the fact that the Government of India had ratified the CRC, children all over  the country, especially those belonging to weaker sections of the society, were  found to be vulnerable and their dignity and human rights were often trampled.  Though, the initial few months of the Commission were spent on making an  overall assessment about the range of issues that affected children, but once  this task was completed, the Commission concentrated its attention on  preventing and eradicating the problems of child labour, child marriage, child  trafficking and prostitution, child sexual violence, female foeticide and  infanticide, child rape, HIV/AIDS in children and the problem of juveniles.</p>
  <h2>Child  Labour </h2>
  <p>The  Commission, first and foremost, concentrated on ending the problem of child  labour, especially those employed in hazardous industries. In order to provide  suitable remedies to the problem of child labour, it made a special effort to  study the plight of these children employed in the glass work and carpet making  industries of Uttar Pradesh, the beedi, match-sticks and fireworks industries  in Tamil Nadu and the slate-pencil making industry in Madhya Pradesh. It  particularly paid attention on the glass work industry in the district of  Ferozabad, Uttar Pradesh, where some 50,000 children were reported to be  working. For this, it evolved an integrated programme, involving the  coordinated efforts of a number of Central Ministries, the Government of Uttar  Pradesh, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders. This programme  was based on three inter-related concepts: income-support for the families from  where children went to work in the glass work industry; schooling, including  the creation of new facilities, for children weaned away from employment; and  rigorous implementation of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act  1986, under which there have been conspicuously few prosecutions and lamentably  fewer convictions. Simultaneously, the Commission consistently took a  supplementary and, in a sense, a different approach to that of the Government.</p>
  <p>This  approach laid emphasis on the provision of free and compulsory education for children  upto the age of 14 years, and the allocation of an appropriate level of  resources to achieve this objective. In taking this stand, the then Department  of Education deliberated on this matter carefully and instead of an all-India  legislation on free and compulsory education, it chose to adopt a different  strategy to achieve the goal of the &ldquo;universalization of elementary education&rdquo;. </p>
  <p>Later,  taking a cue from the landmark judgement delivered by the Supreme Court on 10  December 1996, in writ petition (civil) no. 465/1986 M.C. Mehta vs. State of  Tamil Nadu and Ors., the Commission ensured that the directions given in the  judgement were implemented. In this task, the Chairperson, Members and Special  Rapporteurs of the Commission have toured rigorously to monitor States where  child labour is prevalent. These States are Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh,  Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. It is due to  Commission&rsquo;s continued efforts that education has today become a Fundamental  Right for the children between the age group of 6 and 14 years vide 86th  Amendment of the Constitution. To end the scourge of child labour from the  country, the Commission&rsquo;s efforts have also been directed towards generating  greater awareness and sensitivity in the District Administration and Labour  Departments of concerned States. In order to create awareness among the masses,  it has come out with a &lsquo;Know Your Rights&rsquo; series, in which one of the booklets  deals with the issue of child labour exclusively.</p>
  <h2>Children  as Domestic Help</h2>
  <p>In  1996-97, the Commission received disturbing reports of the employment of  children below the age of 14 years as domestic servants in the homes of  government officials. Unacceptable as the practice is in any circumstance, the  Commission felt that the employment of such children as domestic help in the  homes of government officials was particularly reprehensible. Following a  meeting in January 1996, the Commission decided to recommend that an  appropriate rule be included in the conduct rules of government servants, both  at the Central and State levels, which while prohibiting such employment would  also make it a misconduct inviting a major penalty. The Commission accordingly  requested the Minster of State in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances  and Pensions to take appropriate steps to introduce the rule into the  Government Service (Conduct) Rules 1964, and proposed the precise wording  required for this purpose. This view of the Commission effected necessary  amendments to Conduct Rules of the Central and State Government servants. By  virtue of these amendments, employment of children below 14 years by the  government servants as domestic help now attracts disciplinary action.</p>
  <h2>Problem  of Child Marriage </h2>
  <p>The  widespread persistence of child marriage in certain parts of the country coaxed  the Commission to examine this problem in its enormity. On examination of the  problem, the Commission realised that the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929  (CMRA) should be recast so as to provide for higher penalty for the violations  of the provisions of this Act and also to make the offence cognizable and  non-bailable. In pursuance of NHRC recommendations, the Government of India  introduced &ldquo;The Prevention of Child Marriage Bill&rdquo; in the Rajya Sabha on 20 December  2004 incorporating all the recommendations of the Commission. Later, the Bill  was tabled in the Lok Sabha on 29 November 2005. The Bill was sent for  examination of the Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on  Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice.</p>
  <h2>Trafficking  in Children </h2>
  <p>Alerted  by press reports to the alarming increase in child trafficking and its  ramifications like commercial sexual exploitation, pornography, etc. in Tamil  Nadu and Goa in the year 1995-96, the Commission issued notices to the two  State Governments as well as to the Ministry of Women and Child Development,  Government of India, calling for reports on the situation. Simultaneously, it  also decided to have this issue considered on a regular basis by a Core Group,  consisting of representatives from the National Commission for Women. The main  objective of the Action Research was to find out the trends and dimensions of  trafficking, role of different law enforcement agencies in preventing and  combating trafficking, process of rescue/recovery, rehabilitation and  reintegration and the role of other national institutions and the civil society  in preventing and combating trafficking. The Action Research also examined the  relationship between missing persons vs. trafficking, migration and  trafficking, tourism and trafficking and culturally sanctioned practices and  trafficking.&nbsp; <br>
    Research  by NHRC has also been continuously sensitizing the judicial officers, police  officers, administrative officers, functionaries of Homes, NGO representatives  and the civil society at large. A network of Nodal Officers, two in each State  &ndash; one from the police department and the other from the social welfare/women  and child development department, has been created to effectively deal with the  problem of trafficking.</p>
  <h2>Sexual  Violence Against Children </h2>
  <p>Sexual  violence against children is another sensitive issue in which the Commission in  partnership with Prasar Bharati and UNICEF held four workshops for radio and  television producers to prepare a guidebook to sensitize people The Commission  currently is also in the process of preparing guidelines for speedy disposal of  child rape cases.</p>
  <h2>Female  Foeticide and Infanticide</h2>
  <p>Faced  with the widely prevalent misuse of sex determination tests to commit female foeticide,  the Commission approached the Medical Council of India during the year 1995-96,  to take a position on the ethical aspects of such tests. After reviewing the  matter, the Council decided to suggest suitable amendments to the regulations  governing the code of medical ethics, in order to enable undertaking of  disciplinary proceedings against errant doctors. In the light of  recommendations made by the CRC Committee in its concluding observations. To  counter this problem, the Commission has maintained that vigorous and  comprehensive measures be taken by all States and Union Territories to put an  end to the gruesome problem of female foeticide and infanticide.</p>
  <h2>Right  to Health</h2>
  <p>The  violation of the rights of children has been considered in the Commission from  the angle of health too. In 2000 and 2001, the Commission organised a Workshop  on Human Rights and HIV/AIDS that was followed by a Consultation on Public  Health and Human Rights.. In particular, the Commission asked them to enact and  enforce a legislation to prevent children living with HIV/AIDS from being  discriminated against, including being barred from school.</p>
  <h2>Juvenile  Justice </h2>
  <p>The  Commission has been concerned about the plight of juveniles who come in  conflict with law and those who are in need of care and protection in the  country.&nbsp; It has also undertaken a  research study on the subject along with a non-governmental organisation. The  study on completion will suggest measures for better implementation of the Act.</p>
  <h1>Handling  of Complaints Related to Children</h1>
  <p>The  Commission since its inception has been handling complaints of different kinds  related to children. Majority of the complaints handled by the Commission so  far have been on the issue of child labour, child marriage, juvenile justice,  child trafficking, child rape, missing children, exploitation of children of  varied kinds, deaths in juvenile/observation homes, etc. The Commission till 31  October 2015 had registered 3,885 cases of children. Out of these, 512 cases  pertained to child labour, 204 cases were related to child marriage, 31 cases  were of children who were being misused for commercial sexual exploitation, 385  cases were related to different kinds of exploitation and 61 cases pertained to  trafficking in children. The other cases registered were related to  disappearance, deaths in juvenile/observation homes, sexual harassment/abuse,  rape, etc. </p>
  <p>It is  the intention of the Commission to continue monitoring all situations where  children&rsquo;s rights are being affected. There is an increasing convergence of  positions amongst various sections - the State,<br>
    Human  Rights Institutions and civil society &ndash; that development is one of the  necessary requisites for promotion and protection of human rights and right to  Development. Two challenges need to be met before this right can be taken  seriously in policy and action. The first is to create a robust concept of  development; the second is to identify the practical steps to implement this  right by gearing up the administration and the operation of law. The object of  this right is to reduce disparities, harmonize aspirations of freedom and  dignity with material improvement of human conditions. Neither objective is  possible under conditions of poverty. Poverty often results from willful  neglect and discrimination. Lack of adequate development or that which permits  exclusion and discrimination in allocation of resources paves the way to  increased inequality and marginalization of the poor and the vulnerable. It  denies them their human rights in terms of lack of capacity. In the words of  Nobel laureate, Amartya Sen, &ldquo;the overarching objective of development is to  maximize people&rsquo;s capabilities&ndash; their freedom to lead the kind of lives they  value, and have reason to value.&rdquo; Economic and social inequalities create differences  in access to political power, justice, basic goods and services, all of which  are essential for the full realization of human rights. The process of  development must strive to realize all human rights entitlements of all rights  holders. This is particularly relevant for the poor and the marginalized. For  them, it is necessary that the development process move away from needs based  exercise in charity and assistance to one that creates and sustains genuine  entitlements that span all aspects of their life - economic, social and  cultural as well as civil and political.<br>
    The  second challenge is to translate political commitment to practice. Development  with social justice cannot be achieved in the absence of respect for human  rights. There has to be an enabling environment - legal political, economic and  social - sensitive in the local context for realization of right to  development. The gap between intention and action has undermined the  credibility of several schemes. NHRC targets to be a facilitator to trigger  this process for the realization of the right to development.</p>
