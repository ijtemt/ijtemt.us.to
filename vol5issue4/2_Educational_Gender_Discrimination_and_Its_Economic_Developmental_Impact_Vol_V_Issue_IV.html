Paper Title :<br>Educational Gender Discrimination and Its Economic Developmental Impact
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The countries of Asia are at different levels of economic development. In educational development too they are not uniform. Historical Legacies and other factors have impacted on the modernization course that each country embarked upon. These countries can benefit and are benefiting by doing studies that compare their experience in development with that of the more advanced nations of the west. However, there is much that they can learn by studying about each other inside Asia; likewise, they have much to offer to the outside world.
In what follows we look at the attempts of some of the Asian countries to eliminate gender discrimination in education and how these impacted on their course of modernization. We would also look at the impact of education on the female labor force participation. Finally, we attempt an interregional comparison and the main focus will be on East Asia the best performing region and South Asia the worst performing region. As the countries of Asia stands at different levels of development this exercise is similar to the one that compares a developing countries experience with that of a developed countries historical experience, further countries at nearly the same level of economic development too have much to learn from each other as the educational development and the degree to which the elimination of gender discrimination in education has proceeded aren’t the same.
The benefits that a country gains by eliminating gender discrimination in education are enormous as we will try to document. Likewise, the losses a country undergoes by neglecting to educate girls and women are substantial. Thus any insight we gain by a cross country comparison, and which might hint at some policy prescription. If not a corrective should be welcome.

    <strong><em>KEYWORDS:</em></strong><br>
    <strong><em>Gender, Economic development,  education, educational gender discrimination.</em></strong><strong> </strong><br>
    <strong>I. INTRODUCTION:</strong><strong> </strong><br>
    Discrimination represents a  significant social problem in Pakistan as well as throughout the world. Girls  face discrimination everywhere in the world. They often receive less food than  boys do, have less entree to schooling and work long hours. And societies where  a male child is regarded as more valuable to the family, girls often are denied  the right of life, denied the right to name and nationality. And by being  married off early or forced to stay at home and help in domestic chores, girls  are often denied the right to education and all the advantages that go with it,  the right to associate freely and the rights accompanying unjustified  deprivation of liberty. These all are basic humiliation from family to girls  when boys are regarded as the pillars of tomorrow. <br>
    The convention on the Rights  of the Child (CRC), adopted in 1989 and by now ratified by most countries of  the world, provide an agenda for action in identifying enduring forms of  inequality and discrimination against girls, abolishing practices and  traditions detrimental to the fulfilment of their rights and defining an  effective strategy to promote and protect those rights. But implementation is  necessary to ensure positive changes. Other than the CRC, the Convention on the  Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) is the most extensive and widely  ratified international agreement promoting the rights of girls and women.<br>
    When we talk about the  education system, it reflects the inequality found outside the classroom. Girls  the world over are less likely than their brothers to be attending primary  school. In some cases, where a decision has to be made about which children to  send to school, it is commonly seen that parents decide to invest in their  sons&rsquo; education rather than their daughters. This may reflect the fact that  upon marriage, daughters may no longer contribute to family income and are  therefore not seen as worth investing in.<br>
    There are several gender  discriminations related consequences of child labor as well. Most obvious are  the problems faced by girls who have been sexually exploited. Also girls  working as child domestic workers are often denied medical treatment when  required since they are domestic help and do not share the same status as the  other children in the household. Children who suffer an accident at work may  also feel that this is their own fault for being clumsy or bad at their job,  and the adults and medical personnel who they encounter may have the same  attitude.<br>
    Education is the tool that can  help break the pattern of gender discrimination and bring lasting changes for  women in developing countries like ours. Pakistan has for decades grossly  underinvested in education, and in particular, girls&rsquo; education. Girls&rsquo;  education also means comprehensive change for a society. Educated women are  essential to ending gender bias, starting by reducing the poverty that makes  discrimination even worse in the developing world.<br>
    <strong>II. Definition of Gender:</strong> <br>
    Gender refers to the social  roles and status difference between women and men in a society. These roles are  determined by the social, cultural and economic organizations of a society and  the prevailing religious, moral and legal norms. 'Sex' is a biological term  while gender is a psychological and socio-cultural one (Anderson 1988). <br>
    <strong>III. Gender Inequality:</strong><br>
    Today social class is based in  the economy and in the status achieved within that realm. In the past social  class rested in part on achieved status in the economic activities of the  society, but also in great part on the ascribed status of the family. That is  one could earn position in the class system but family status helped gain and  maintain that position. The ethnic and racial status affects one's position in  the economy. Gender, as defined by the society serves to assign position and worth  in the society. Inequality based on gender exists within our society. The  ascribed and achieved role and status of women, the relative power of men and  women is discriminative in our society. There is gender inequality in role-play  and rights (Oakley, 1972)<br>
    <strong>IV. GENDER INEQUALITY AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE:</strong><br>
    There have been a number of  theoretical and empirical studies &#64257;nding that gender inequality in  education and employment reduces economic growth. The main arguments from the  literature, which are discussed in detail in <strong>Stephan Klan (1999, 2002, 2006),</strong> are brie&#64258;y summarized  below. Regarding gender inequality in education, the theoretical literature  suggests as a &#64257;rst argument that such gender inequality reduces the  average amount of human capital in a society and thus harms economic  performance. It does so by arti&#64257;cially restricting the pool of talent  from which to draw for education, thereby excluding highly quali&#64257;ed  girls (and taking less quali&#64257;ed boys instead; see, for example, Dollar  and Gatti [1999]). Moreover, if there are declining marginal returns to  education, restricting the education of girls to lower levels while taking the  education of boys to higher levels means that the marginal return to educating  girls is higher than that of boys, and thus would boost overall economic  performance <strong>(World Bank 2001; Knowles, Lorgelly,  and Owen 2002). </strong><br>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong>A second argument relates to  the externalities of female education. Promoting female education is known to  reduce fertility levels, reduce child mortality levels, and promote the  education of the next generation. Each factor in turn has a positive impact on  economic growth. Thus, gender gaps in education reduce the bene&#64257;ts to  society of high female education (see, for example<strong>, </strong>Galor and Weil [1996<strong>]; </strong>Lagerlo&uml;f  [2003]; World Bank [2001]; and King, Klasen, and Porter [2008]) There is also  an important timing issue involved here. Reduced fertility levels will, after  some twenty years, lead to a favorable demographic constellation which David E<strong>. </strong>Bloom and<strong> </strong>Jeffrey G. Williamson (1998) refer to as a &lsquo;&lsquo;demographic gift.&rsquo;&rsquo;  For a period of several decades, the working-age population will grow much  faster than the overall population, thus lowering dependency rates with positiv<strong>e </strong>repercussions for per capita economic  growth.<strong> </strong><br>
    A third argument relates to  international competitiveness. Many East Asian countries have been able to be  competitive in world markets through the use of women-intensive export-oriented  manufacturing industries, a strategy that is now &#64257;nding followers in South  Asia and individual countries across the developing world (see, for example,  Stephanie Seguino [2000a, 2000b]).7 For such competitive export industries to  emerge and grow, women need to be educated and there must be no barrier to  their employment in such sectors. Gender inequality in education and employment  would reduce the ability of countries to capitalize on these opportunities <strong>(</strong>World Bank 2001; Busse and Spielmann  2006<strong>).</strong> Regarding gender gaps in  employment, there are a number of closely related arguments. First, the  literature argues that it distorts the economy, as do gender gaps in education.  It arti&#64257;cially reduces the pool of talent from which employers can draw,  thereby reducing the average ability of the workforce (see, for example, Esteve-Volart  [2004]). Such distortions would not only affect the dependent employed, but  similar arguments could be made for the self-employed in agricultural and  non-agricultural sectors where unequal access to critical inputs, technologies,  and resources would reduce the average productivity of these ventures, thereby  reducing economic growth (Mark Blackden, Sudharshan Canagarajah, Stephen  Klasen, and David Lawson [2007]).<br>
    &nbsp;As self-employment (including in agriculture)  is included in our empirical assessment, these arguments might have some  empirical relevance in accounting for the results. A second and also closely  related argument suggests that gender inequality in employment can reduce  economic growth via demographic effects. A model by Cavalcanti and<strong> </strong>Tavares (2007) suggests that gender  inequality in employment would be associated with higher fertility levels,  which in turn reduce economic growth. Third, the results by Seguino (2000a,  2000b) on the impact of gender gaps in pay on international competitiveness imply  that gender gaps in employment access would also reduce economic growth, as it  would deprive countries&rsquo; use of (relatively cheap) women&rsquo;s labor as a  competitive advantage in an export-oriented growth strategy. A fourth argument  relates to the importance of women&rsquo;s employment and earnings for their  bargaining power within families. There is a sizable literature that  demonstrates that women&rsquo;s employment and earnings increase their bargaining  power in the home (for example, Amartya Sen [1990]; Lawrence James Haddad, John  Hoddinott, and Harold Alderman [1997]; Duncan Thomas [1997]; World Bank [2001];  Stephan Klasen and Claudia Wink [2003]; and King, Klasen, and Porter [2008]).  This greater bargaining power not only bene&#64257;ts the women concerned, but  can also have a range of growth-enhancing effects. These could include higher  savings, as women and men differ in their savings behavior (see, for example,  Stephanie Seguino and Maria Sagrario Floro [2003]), more productive investments  and use and repayment of credit (see Janet Stotsky [2006]), and higher  investments in the health and education of their children, thus promoting the  next generation&rsquo;s human capital, and therefore economic growth (see, for  example, Thomas [1997] and World Bank [2001]). A &#64257;fth argument relates  to governance. There is a growing but still rather speculative and suggestive  literature that has collated evidence that women workers, on average, appear to  be less prone to corruption and nepotism than men workers (World Bank 2001; Anand  Swamy, Omar Azfar, Stephen Knack and Young Lee 2001). If these &#64257;ndings  prove to be robust, greater levels of women&rsquo;s employment might be  bene&#64257;cial for economic performance in this sense as well.9 &nbsp;<br>
    There is a related theoretical  literature that examines the impact of gender discrimination in pay on economic  performance. Here, the theoretical literature is quite divided. On the one  hand, studies by Galor and Weil (1996) and Cavalcanti and Tavares (2007)  suggest that large gender pay gaps will reduce economic growth. Such gender pay  gaps reduce female employment, increase fertility, and lower economic growth  through these participation and demographic effects. In contrast, Blecker and  Seguino (2002) highlight a different mechanism, leading to contrasting results.  They suggest that high gender pay gaps and associated low female wages increase  the competitiveness of export-oriented industrializing economies and thus boost  the growth performance of these countries. The most important difference in  this study, in contrast to the models considered above, is that it focuses more  on short-term, demand-induced growth effects, while the other models are  long-term growth models where growth is driven by supply constraints. Clearly,  both effects can be relevant, depending on the time horizon considered, an  issue that is also discussed brie&#64258;y below. &nbsp;<br>
    It is important to point out  that it is dif&#64257;cult to theoretically separate the effects between gender  gaps in education, employment, and pay. In fact, in most of the models  considered above, gender gaps in one dimension tend to lead to gender gaps in  other dimensions, with the causality running in both directions.10 For example,  gender gaps in education might automatically lead to gender gaps in employment,  particularly in the formal sector, where employers will prefer educated workers  and thus will not consider the applications of uneducated women. Conversely, if  there are large barriers to female employment or gender gaps in pay, rational  parents (and girls) might decide that the education of girls is not as  lucrative, which might therefore lead to lower demands for female education and  the resulting gender gaps in education.11 Thus, gender gaps in education and  employment are closely related.12 Gender gaps in education and employment are  not measuring the same thing, however, and thus it is important to investigate  them separately. <br>
    &nbsp;For one, it might be the case that the two  issues are largely driven by institutional factors that govern education and  employment access and do not therefore greatly depend on each other. For  example, one might think of an education policy that strives to achieve  universal education and thus reduces gender gaps, while there continue to be  considerable barriers to employment for women in the labor market. This might  be particularly relevant to the situations in the MENA and most recently South  Asia. Moreover, the externalities of female education and female employment are  not the same.<br>
    &nbsp;For example, female education is likely to  lead to lower fertility and child mortality of the offspring, while the effect  of female employment on these items is likely to be much smaller and more  indirect (working mainly through greater women&rsquo;s bargaining power; and there  may also be opposite effects, including that the absence of women in the home  might in some cases have a negative impact on the quality of childcare).  Conversely, the governance externality applies solely to female employment, not  to female education. On the empirical evidence, there is a considerable  literature now documenting that gender gaps in education reduce economic  growth. Elizabeth M. King and M. Anne Hill (1993) as well as Knowles, Lorgelly,  and Owen (2002) use a Solow-growth framework, and &#64257;nd that gender gaps  in education have alarge and statistically signi&#64257;cant negative effect on  the level of gross domestic product (GDP). Dollar and Gatti (1999), Forbes  (2000), Yamarik and Ghosh (2003), Elizabeth N. Appiah and Walter W. McMahon  (2002), and Klasen (2002) investigate the impact of gender gaps on economic  growth, and all &#64257;nd that gender gaps in education have a negative impact  on subsequent economic growth. They also &#64257;nd that the earlier results by  Barro and Lee (1994), that female education might negatively impact economic growth,  do not stand up to closer econometric scrutiny. There are far fewer empirical  studies on the impact of gender gaps in employment and pay on economic growth,  which is largely due to the data and econometric issues discussed above. Klasen  (1999) found that increases in female labor force participation and  formal-sector employment were associated with higher growth in a cross-country  context. &nbsp;<br>
    Differences in female  participation and employment might have accounted for another 0.3 percentage  points in the growth difference between the MENA region and EAP. But these  &#64257;ndings have to be treated with caution as they may suffer from reverse  causality. In particular, it might be the case that high growth draws women  into the labor force (rather than increasing female participation promoting  economic growth). There are no easy ways to correct for this econometrically,  as there are unlikely to be valid instruments that can be used. Also, there are  questions about the international comparability of data on labor force participation  and formal-sector employment rates. To the extent that the problems of  comparability affect levels but not trends over time, these problems might be  avoided in a &#64257;xed effects panel setting as the one we are undertaking  here. At the sub-national level, Esteve-Volart (2004) has found statistically  signi&#64257;cant negative effects of gender gaps in employment and managerial  positions on economic growth of India&rsquo;s states using panel data and controlling  for endogeneity using instrumental variables.<br>
    &nbsp;There are some papers by Seguino (2000a,  2000b) that support the contention that the combination of low gender gaps in  education and employment with large gender gaps in pay (and resulting low  female wages) were a contributing factor to the growth experience of export oriented,  middle-income countries. A paper by Busse and Spielmann (2006), which &#64257;nds  for a sample of twenty-three developing countries that a combination of low  gender gaps in education and employment and large gender gaps in pay helped  promote exports, supports this empirical claim. Unfortunately, there are no  comprehensive, standardized, and comparable data on gender pay gaps across many  countries, so these analyses have been based on relatively small and rather  speci&#64257;c samples of countries.13 Also empirically, there are some  questions about the separation of the effects of gender gaps in education and  labor force participation or employment. Regressions that only consider the  effect of gender gaps in education might implicitly also measure the impact of  gender gaps in employment, particularly if the two are highly correlated. Such high  correlation might also make it dif&#64257;cult to separately identify the effects  when both are included in a regression (due to the multicollinearity  problem).14 Also, it will be dif&#64257;cult to assess which of the two is the  causal driver of the other, given the close and plausible theoretical and empirical  linkage. In sum, there is considerable theoretical support for the notion that  gender gaps in education and employment are likely to reduce economic  performance (while the literature on the effect of gender gaps in pay is more  divided). The empirical results also point to negative effects of gender gaps  in education, but there is little reliable cross-country evidence on gender  gaps in employment. In the following section, we will discuss the gender gaps  in education and employment by developing region before estimating the impact  of these gaps before economic performance. <br>

    A second argument relates to  the externalities of female education. Promoting female education is known to  reduce fertility levels, reduce child mortality levels, and promote the  education of the next generation. Each factor in turn has a positive impact on  economic growth. Thus, gender gaps in education reduce the bene&#64257;ts to  society of high female education (see, for example, Galor and Weil [1996];  Lagerlo&uml;f [2003]; World Bank [2001]; and King, Klasen, and Porter [2008]).

    <strong>VI. GENDER DICRIMINATION IN PAKISTAN:</strong><br>
    Poverty in Pakistan has  historically been higher in rural areas and lower in the cities. Out of the  total 47 million living below the poverty line. 35 million live in rural areas.  Poverty rose sharply and the rural areas in the 1990s and the gap in income  between urban and rural areas of the country became more significant. This  trend has been attributed to a disproportionate impact of the Economic slowdown  in the rural areas caused by low economic growth, decline in public sector  development spending and lower worker remunerations. There are also significant  variations in the different regions of Pakistan that contribute to the country&rsquo;s  rising poverty. In the 1990s fiscal year the urban regions of the Sindh Province  had the lowest levels of Poverty. And the rural areas of North West frontier Province  had the highest. Punjab also has significant gradients in poverty among the  different regions of the Province. In addition, the NWFP of Pakistan are among  the most impoverished in the country. Outside the cities, government investment  has been negligible and social economic structures remained tribal and  backward. In the absence of economic development, the Pashtun people of the  region dealt in arms n drugs smuggling people and goods especially during the  Soviet Invasion of neighboring Afghanistan and later in support of the Taliban  regime. These activities have led to breakdown of law and order in many parts  of the region.<br>
    The gender discriminatory  practices in Pakistan society also shape the distribution of poverty in the  country. Traditional gender roles in Pakistan define women place as in the home  and not in the workplace and define men as breadwinner. Consequently, the  society invests far less in women than man. Women in Pakistan suffer from  poverty of opportunities throughout their lives. Female literacy in Pakistan is  29% compared to male literacy 55%. In legislative bodies women consist less  than 35% of the legislature elected on general seats. The 1973 constitutional  reform allowed reserved seats for women would be represented in Parliament  regardless of whether or not they are elected on general seats. This provision  lapsed in 1993 so parliament elected subsequently did not have reserved seats  for women. <br>
    All this coupled with rise of  honor killing against women, a legal system that is regarded as misogynistic  and the intransigent denial of these problems by the Pakistan government as  well as their institutionalized harassment of women rights groups operating in  the country contribute the deteriorating situation. <strong>(Amnesty International</strong> <strong>1995)</strong>. <br>
    <strong>VII. BARRIERS TO GENDER EDUCATION:</strong><br>
    The denial of access to  education, or the creation of conditions that discourage girls from continuing  in school, ultimately lead to educational inequalities between men and women.  Countries with low girl's enrollment ae also those where overall gross  enrollment rates are low. In other words, smaller the proportion of primary  school children in school the larger the gender gap in enrollments. Second the  dropout rates are higher fir girls than boys. Third adult illiteracy rates are  usually much higher for women than men.<br>
    When a person faces the  disadvantage of being a woman and also being poor the gender differences are  increased further. While 80% of girls from household in the top 20% complete grade  8, only 9.5% from the poorest 40% are able to do so. Families look upon the  direct and indirect costs of sending daughters to school as being prohibitive. In  terms of provision of books and stationary, uniforms and clothing, as well as  the forgoing of vital help at home and o the land. In INDIA it has been found  that wealth and gender disparities can combine to create a huge disadvantage  for girls and women in the poorest stratum of society.<br>
    The way education is provided  can itself as a deterrent. The difficulties in accessibility, lack of resources  and low teacher quality and morale, lack of women primary teachers in rural  areas, difficulties in synchronizing the schooling terms with the time dictates  of seasonal activities of the local economy and similar factors tend to  discourage girl from participating in education. Of late significant gains have  been made in women education in which global advocacy and donor pressure have  had their role to play. However, these fragile gains are vulnerable to changes  in economic and social environments.<br>
    The literature suggests that  families might consider the economic returns of girls to be lesser than that of  boys. Or it could be an expectation that sons could be providing old age  security. Households further have fewer incentives to invest in the education  of girls, education as their labor market returns are lesser compared to men.  Or it could be due to religious factors. Thus the causes of educational deprivation  for girls are many. Aspects like household resources, parental motivation,  returns to child labor and school quality affect it. <br>

  <p align="center"><strong>X. CONCLUSION:</strong><br>
    Poverty is a worldwide issue  and growing. If poverty is analyzed through gender perspectives, we find that  women are more vulnerable to poverty because of inequality in different socio-economic  aspects and the culture of patriarchy. After analyzing the data, it is  concluded that a disparity exists in targeted areas which on many grounds  affect poverty alleviation and development. The study indicates that women have  no or low share in income earning of the family. All female and few male  respondents specified that there was no equal status of women. Females were not  allowed to work outside home. Women are more vulnerable to poverty. Women can  carry burden of productive and household work. If this burden share equally it  could help in poverty alleviations household poverty could be reduced when both  male and female members earn. Male members were the decision makers in their  houses they were not equal opportunities in higher education for women and women  are facing difficulties in laborer market. The study shows that quality  education can help in poverty alleviates while gender inequality hinders poverty  alleviation.<br>
    On the basis of findings  following recommendations are made:<br>
    Equal educational opportunities  should be provided to women and also skill training facilities should be  provided to them. Women should be given equal rights and power of decision  making. There is a need to bring equality in resources distribution equal  opportunities of participation should be given to both genders in various  activities. Equal opportunities should be given to the women inside the family  affairs as well as outside the family. Equal opportunities should be provided  to women in different jobs. It will be very helpful in poverty alleviation and  development of the economy increasing GDP GNP NNP and Per Capita Income.<br>
