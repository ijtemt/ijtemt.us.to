  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>Uttarakhand  is a state in the northern Himalayan region in India and it has been a popular  spot of tourism due to its admirably various landscape, rich cultural heritage,  high biodiversity and enough religious potential. Which has also generated a  good source of income and employment to youth and rural mass. Tourism is a  major social phenomenon of modern society. Today tourism is also considered as  an agent of economic development of the country. In terms of revenue generation  as well as employer in the world, tourism is now become a largest source.</p>
  <h1>Role  of Tourism Activities in Economic Development of State</h1>
  <p>Tourism  can play a very significant position for leveraging limited foreign exchange  earnings for not only the developing countries of the third world but for Most  of the developed countries in the world. It offers employment to various semi-skilled  and unskilled people. Tourism gives a momentum to State income. In Uttarakhand,  tourism is considered to be an essential medium for economic development. To  create foreign exchange earnings tourism industry has such potential, tourism  promote development in various parts of the region, create employment and help  to lighten poverty. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A more complete view point can be  provided for various parts of country. A more complete picture can be provided  by the concept of tourism development, because it can help policy maker to make  effective policy to realize the social and economic potential of the tourism  industry. Several types of business such as hotels, restaurants, tour operator&rsquo;s  handicrafts, transporters, travel agents, etc, can get benefit from it. Other  related businesses such as cab drivers, adventure sports arrangers, and food  and beverage suppliers, photographers can also have lucrative earnings.  Employment in tourism sector is very much important for Uttarakhand. As it is  mainly an agriculture based economy where industries have not much developed.  Tourism development is foundation on the responsibility of governments and all  the stakeholders in the tourism sector to ensure the long term prosperity and  quality of life for future generation. It should make optimal use of  environment resource that constitutes a key element in tourism development.</p>
  <h1>Current  Challenges for Tourism Promotion in Uttarakhand</h1>
  <p>Restoring  tourism in disaster Uttarakhand has been one of the biggest challenges before  the state government. The national media&rsquo;s focus on the predicament of tourists  has grossly deformed the true nature of the tragedy even in the Char Dham area.  Many of the people who come from their villages in these valleys and elsewhere  to earn income for their families&rsquo; on yatra routes during the tourist season  are still missing many of them were dead and many of them had feared to death.  They work in the dhabas that line the entire route from GauriKund to Kedarnath  which is almost 14 km track; they sell raincoats, umbrellas, soft drinks, water  bottles, snacks and other goods. They carry children on their backs, the sick,  the old and tourists who are simply unfit and out of condition to walk the  entire route. They run along the path with their horses carrying tourists. <br>
    Most of  the&nbsp; families dependent on religious  tourism for much of their annual income is multifaceted by the fact that the  yatra season is over for the year, and is unlikely to resume even next year  given the damage of the roads and bridges in the upper reaches. Thousands of  families who lives near Char Dham valley will now fall below the poverty line.  Till the revival of the yatras, what will be the alternative sources of  employment for the unemployed? Most likely we will see increased male outmigration  from the region.</p>
  <h1>Reasons  for Disaster in Uttarakhand</h1>
  <p>Many  researchers and experts viewed that Uttarakhand recent disasters are man-made,  they said unabated expansion of hydro-power projects and building roads for  lodging ever-increasing tourism are major causes for the unprecedented level of  destruction. The valley of Yamuna, Ganga, and Alakhananda witness heavy traffic  of tourists. Therefore many people build their hotels, Restaurants, Dhabas or  stalls near rivers.</p>
  <h2>Inadequate  Infrastructure</h2>
  <p>Hilly  and unreceptive territory, absorbent boundaries, highly inadequate road  connectivity and poor transport connectivity, very limited air services,  scarcity of&nbsp; rail links and weak  telecommunication network, etc has constrained the growth of tourism in the  State. Most places of tourist attraction especially pilgrims are too far from  the national highways, and approach roads are in worst condition. This is a  strong disappointing factor, which works in opposition to a good visiting of  the tourist. Apart from the infrastructural bottleneck, lack of well managed  package tour, lack of facilities like good hotels and tourist lodges,  reasonable and reliable communication system, etc have been slow down the  expected development and promotion of tourism in the state.</p>
  <h2>Rebellion</h2>
  <p>The  media often inclined to focus on the ethnic conflicts and under development of  the State neglecting the revolutionary development efforts made in the region.  It has been stamped in the minds of the general papules by the media that  nothing significant is happening in the region other than violence.</p>
  <h2>Absence  of Certified Tourist Guides</h2>
  <p>Uttarakhand  virtually does not have any trained or experienced guides consigned in  important places of tourist attraction. As a result, as the tourists arrive at  such a place there is hardly few people who satisfy the curiosity of the  tourists. The Department of Tourism need to initiate such programs to train  tourist guides. </p>
  <h2>Lack  of Synchronized Efforts</h2>
  <p>There is  a blatant lack of synchronization among numerous agencies like Department of  Tourism and Department of Archaeology in handling the requirements or anxiety  of the tourists in places of both historic and religious substance. There is no  coordination connecting various public and private sectors. This is definitely  a big blockage on the way of tourism industry.</p>
  <h2>Under-Developed  Human Resource</h2>
  <p>To  provide thorough information to the tourists regarding the region, pilgrims  etc. There is lack of trained tourist guides, which apparently main obstacle in  the path of development of tourism industry in Uttarakhand.<br>
    Thus  even though plentiful of natural beauty, the flow of incoming tourist has been  marginal for the reasons of the lack of such facilities in various tourist  places in the state.</p>
  <h1>Strategies  for Promoting Tourism in Uttarakhand</h1>
