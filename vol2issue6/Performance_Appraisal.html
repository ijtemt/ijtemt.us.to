  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Century  pulp &amp; paper a unit of century textiles &amp; industries ltd. &amp; a  member of B.K.BIRLAGroup of companies is blessed with the able &amp; astute  guidance of its chairman BASANT KUMAR JI BIRLA.The Company is a pioneer in  bringing industralisation in lalkuan, Small Township of distt. Nainital in  Uttarakhand on barielly nainital road, 29 Deg. 5&rsquo;minute. N latitude&amp; 79  Deg. 30&rsquo; minute E longitudes, Elevation of 257m above mean sea level. The  company has a human resource base of around 2282 people .<br>
    Century  pulp &amp; paper was established in 1984 with an installed capacity of 20,000  TPA of writing printing paper &amp; 20,000 TPA of rayon grade pulp. After  modernization &amp; expansion, presently the production capacities have risen  to 31300 TPA rayon grade pulp, 37250 TPA paper (wood based plant) &amp; 84600  TPA paper (bagasse based plant). The bagasse based paper plant of CPP is unique  in the country.  It is equipped with  latest technology to produce bagasse paper of competitive quality in national  as well as international market. The company is pioneer in bagasse based paper  manufacturing throughout the country.<br>
    CPP  is one organization where paper from two different raw materials &amp; rayon  grade pulp are manufactured under one roof. The company makes wide variety of  writing printing paper &amp; high quality dissolving grade pulp.                         <br>
    In  order to gauge the performance of employees in terms of their quality and  quantity of work, performance assessment is carried out at regular intervals  for further improvement, development and advancement of performance so as to  achieve organization's objectives as well as overall development of employees.  To reward an employee for the certain level of target achieved performance  appraisal is used. The measurement of performance in the Century Pulp and Paper  is carried out with the help of different tools for different levels of employees  described below :<br>
    a) Performance Planning Review and  Development(PPRD)-Quarterly<br>
    b) Annual Individual Merit Ratting <br>
    c) Performance Appraisal-Annual<br>
    d) Self Assessment-Annual <br>
    In  Century Pulp and Paper the application of performance technique is for the  staff and other higher level employees. The reason for limiting the application  is the high staff and workman in the organization to the extent of 2282. The  performance measurement for the superintendent and above is done through PPRD .<br>
    According  to Roland Benjamin a &ldquo;performance appraisal determines who shell receive merit  increases&rdquo; counsels employees on their improvement, determines training needs,  determines promotion ability, identifies those who should be transferred.  Moreover it improves employees job performance, encourages employees to express  their views or to seek clarification on job duties, broadens there outlook,  capacity and potential, promotes a more effective utilization of man power and  improves placement, facilitates selection, reward and promotion of the best  qualified employee, prevents grievances and increases the analytical abilities  of supervisors.<br>

          To let the employees know where they stand  in so as  their performance in concerned  and to assist them with constructive criticism and guidance for the purpose of  their development.<br>
          To improve communication.<br>
          To evaluate whether H.R. programs such as  selection, training, transfers are being effective or not.<br>
          To discriminate between efficient and  inefficient workers.<br>
          To assign the individual work for which  they are best suited.<br>
          To prevent employee grievances.</p>
  <h1>Barriers to Effective Appraisal</h1>
  <p>Appraisal  of personnel, both performance and potential, is used by every organization  either formally or informally. However, this is full of shortcomings and  limitations. There are certain barriers, which work against the effective  appraisal systems. Some of these barriers are more pronounced in specific  methods of appraisal, in some methods. Identification of these barriers is  essential so that suitable measures any be adopted to reduce their impact to a  possible minimum level. The barriers to effective appraisal may be grouped in  three categories:<br>
    1.      Faulty assumptions<br>
    2.      Psychological blocks, and<br>
    3.      Technical pitfalls.<br>
    1.  FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS<br>
    Faulty  assumptions of the parties concerned – superior and his subordinate – in  appraisal system, leads to non proper working or objectively. These faulty assumptions  work against an appraisal system  as:<br>
    1)            The  assumption about fair and accurate appraisal among the managers for subordinates  is untenable. Both superiors and subordinates show tendencies to avoid formal  appraisal processes, as well as to head them in their respective work roles. <br>
    2)            The  managers also have a faulty assumption that what they have prepared once will  last longer and will not require any changes in future. It should be recognized  that no system can provide perfect, absolutely defensible, appraisal devoid of  subjectivity.<br>
    2. PSYCHOLOGICAL BLOCKS<br>
    There  psychological blocks that works against an effective appraisal system are:  managers feeling of insecurity, appraisal as an extra burden, their being  excessively modes or skeptical, their feeling to treat their subordinate&rsquo;s  failure as their deficiency.<br>
    3.  TECHNICAL PITFALLS<br>
    Technical  pitfall lies in two categories:<br>
    1) CRITERION PROBLEM<br>
    It  is the standard of performance set by the senior for his subordinate and  keeping it benchmark he compares his subordinates performance.<br>
    2) DISTORTIONS<br>
    Distortions  are the error and biasedness in evaluating the performance. Evaluator may  introduce such distortions consciously or unconsciously. Distortions are:<br>
    (A) HALO EFFECT<br>
    When  rater is influenced by rate&rsquo;s one or two outstandingly good (of bad)  performances and he evaluates the entire performance based upon that.<br>
    (B) CENTRAL TENDENCY<br>
    When  failing in discriminating best and the worst he marks average to all. The main  reason for this is his lack of knowledge, taste, indifference, or carelessness.<br>
    (C) CONSTANT ERRORS<br>
    This  error arises because of the nature of the observer. It might be possible that  some observer always gives higher marks and some always give low. But there  might be chances that some of the observer may give marks on potential  performance rather than on recent one.<br>
    (D) OBSERVER&rsquo;S LIKING  AND DISLIKING<br>
    Superiors  closeness or distance to some of his subordinates results into liking or  disliking, which influences his observation and hence rating to them. There  might be personal or emotional reasons for such biases.</p>
  <h1>Objectives of Performance Appraisal</h1>
  <p>Performance  appraisal practices show that organizations undertake performance appraisal to  meet certain objectives which are in the form of salary increase, promotion,  identifying training and development needs, providing feedback to employees and  putting pressure on employees for better performance.<br>
    1.  SALARY INCREASE: Performance appraisal is a tool in planning salary hikes. Usually  salary hikes are dependent on employee&rsquo;s performances. Upon these performances  there are continuous formal and informal evaluations conducted by superiors. In  a small organization, since there is a direct contact between the employee and  the one who make3s decisions about salary increase, performance appraisal can  be an informal process. However, in a large organization where such contact  hardly exists, formal performance appraisal has to be undertaken. This is an  indicator of employee&rsquo;s performance and based upon the performance deciding his  compensation plan.<br>
    2.  PROMOTION: Performance appraisal plays a significant role where promotion is  based on merit. Most of the organizations often use a combination of merit and  seniority for promotion. Performance appraisal disclosed how an employee is  working in his present job and what his strong and weak points are. In the  light of these, it can be decided whether he can be promoted to the next higher  position and what additional training will be necessary for him. Similarly,  performance appraisal can be used for transfer, demotion and discharge of an  employee.<br>
    3.  TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT: Performance appraisal tries to identify the strengths  and weaknesses of an employee on his present job. This information can be used  for devising training and development programmes appropriate for overcoming  weaknesses of the employees. In fact, many organizations use performance  appraisal as means for identifying training needs of employees.<br>
    4.      FEEDBACK:<br>
    Performance  appraisal provides feedback to employees about their performance. It tells them  where they stand. A person works better when he knows how he is working; how  his efforts are contributing to the achievement of organizational objectives.  This works in two ways. First, the person gets feedback about his performance  and he may try to overcome his deficiencies, which will lead to better  performance. Second, when the person gets feedback about this performance, he  can relate his work to the organizational objectives. <br>
    This  provides him satisfaction that his work is meaningful. Thus, given the proper  organizational climate, he will try his bet to contribute maximum to the  origination.<br>
    5.  PRESSURE ON EMPLOYEES<br>
    Performance  appraisal puts a sort of pressure on employees for better performance. If the  employees are conscious that they are being appraised in respect of certain factors  and their future largely depends on such appraisal, they tend to have positive  and acceptable behaviour in this respect. Thus, appraisal can work  automatically as control device.<br>
    Above  roles of performance appraisal are quite important. However, these roles can be  performed only when there is systematic performance appraisal, and various  relevant decisions are made objectively in the light of result of performance  appraisal. To be systematic and objective in performance appraisal, managers  require an understanding of various intricacies involved in performance  appraisal like methods of performance appraisal, problems in performance  appraisal and have these problems can be overcomes. </p>
  <h1>Data Analysis, Finding and Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Along  with secondary data available from the company&rsquo;s documents, primary data is  also collected using a closed ended questionnaire survey among 50 employees of  the company using a convenience sampling. And the findings can be made on the  basis of following results:</p>
  <h2> Does performance appraisal system reflects the  real picture of an employee&rsquo;s performance? </h2>
  <p>a) Always                                         b)  Often <br>
    c) Seldom                                        d)  Never<br>
    <img src="PerformanceAppraisal_clip_image002.gif" alt="PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL: A CASE STUDY OF CPP LALKUAN" width="336" height="247"> The graph interprets  that only 45.71 % of staff persons believe that the performance appraisal  system reflect the real picture of performance always whereas 51.42 % staff  person believe that it reflects of performance often. The few 2.87 % of staff  persons think that it provide performance real picture seldom. The above graph  depicts that the performance system needs to be more performance related with  context to the employee. </p>
  <h2> Does performance system help to improve one&rsquo;s knowledge and  skills?</h2>
  <p>a) Yes                                         b) To  some extent <br>
    c) No                                          d)  Can&rsquo;t say<br>
    <img src="PerformanceAppraisal_clip_image004.gif" alt="PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL: A CASE STUDY OF CPP LALKUAN" width="336" height="243"><br>
