  <p><em>Abstract</em>— India is predominantly an Agrarian state with more than 50 percent  of the population directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture and allied  activities. This easily shows that agriculture is backbone of Indian economy  and social fabric. Infrastructure plays an important role in the growth of any  sector. The paper tries to list down all the basic infrastructural facilities  that are required for proper carrying out of agriculture as a business. It also  checks whether these facilities are available to the farmers of the region and  how they affect the growth of agriculture sector in hilly state of India. The area  chosen for the study is Nainital district of Uttarakhand. Questionnaire method  was used for collecting the data for the research. The major finding of the  research is that agriculture has lot of potential in hilly areas but the  farmers of region are devoid of the basic infrastructural facilities required  for the agricultural business.  <br>

  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Uttarakhand  is a newly carved state out of Uttar Pradesh. The reason for creating a  separate state out of the existing state was the fact that geographical and  topographical factors of both the regions were quite different. Around 93  percent of the total area is hilly terrain having geographical features quite  different from that of Uttar Pradesh. This change in geographical and  topographical aspects associated with the hilly areas of Uttarakhand leads to  change in the farming practices followed by the farmers of the region. Area under Agriculture and allied activities  is 23.6% i.e. is around 13.37 lakh hectare. Being hilly terrain the farmers  have an edge with respect to farmers of other areas in cultivation of  vegetables. The seasonal vegetables grown in hilly areas have different sowing  and harvesting time than that of plain (Tarai and Bhabar) areas. This creates a  niche in the marketing scenario for the farmers of the region by marketing  their produce as off-season vegetables. This can easily help farmers in  attaining premium prices for the produce grown in the region. On one hand this  hilly terrain has its benefit on another the farmers have to face a lot of  problems because of the same. Proper Infrastructural facilities are required  for carrying out agricultural production and marketing in a profitable manner.  Being hilly terrain it&rsquo;s always tough to have appropriate infrastructural  facilities that is pre-requisite for any business. The paper tries to identify  the basic infrastructural facilities that are available for the farmers of the  region and its impact on production and marketing of vegetables </p>
  <h1>Review of Literature</h1>
  <p>Sati  V.P. (2006) in the study on Off-Season vegetable farming in the Pindar Basin  reveals he identified that the region of Pindar valley is suitable for  vegetable production. Potato and onion are the major crops grown in those areas  that suitable in that climatic condition. Along with these two crops farmers of  the region are cultivating spices and green vegetables. The cultivation of  these vegetables is yielding good results to the farmers and enhancing their  livelihood. But this activity has few constraints also. The availability of  quality seed of improved varieties, other inputs like fertilizers, availability  of transportation facility and warehouses were identified as few factors that  act as constraint in this basin.<br>
    Arya  Singh Prem (2000) has authored a book on, &lsquo;Off-Season Vegetables growing in  hills.&rsquo; The book deals with the different aspects of vegetable production in  hills and their marketing and also provides an insight about the vegetable  production in the Himanchal region. Besides this it explains the role of  extension services, new technologies and various constraints in the vegetable  production and few techniques of marketing. He in his study showed that  extension services play an important role in the farmer&rsquo;s entrepreneurship.<br>
    Tamasese Edwin (December 2009<strong>)</strong> had responsibility to identify and evaluate few major shortcoming  and lacunae in value chain of representative crop of papaya, breadfruit,  cabbage and tomatoes in Samoa. This major aim of this exercise is to develop an  implementable activity in support of Fruit and vegetable sector strategy. The  technique of value chain mapping along with gross margin analysis was used to  identify the impact these lacunas and constraints by simply estimating the loss  in present value chain because of these constraints </p>
  <h1>Objectives of the Study</h1>
  <h2>To identify different infrastuructual facilites avaialbe for the  farmers of Uttarakhand. </h2>
  <h2>To study the impact of these infrastrucutrual facilites on the  production and marketing of the vegetables.</h2>
  <h1>METHODOLOGY </h1>
  <p>The developmental Blocks namely Bhimtal, Dhari, Okhalkanda and  Ramgarh predominately the hilly belts of district Nainital were taken for the  purpose of study. From these villages 190 families, giving equal representation  to all the developmental blocks of the district has been sampled for the study.  <br>
    Block  wise Number of Off-Season Vegetables Growers families and the sampled Units  selected for the study (shown in Table no. 1):</p>

  <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
  <p>The  basic Infrastructural facilities that are desired by the farmers for production  and marketing of vegetables in hilly areas of Uttarakhand  are irrigation, availability of roads and  transportation facilities , warehouses for storage , and proper marketing  system suitable for selling the produce in the market and information regarding  agricultural practices. Now in this portion we will try and discuss the  condition of these infrastructural facilities available to the farmers of hilly  areas.   <br>

    The table shows that out of 190 respondent  only 14 have land holding near to at road head. This is just 7.37 percent of  the total number of respondent. More than 47.37 percent of respondent in the  block have land holding more than 1km from road head. 30 percent respondents  from all the blocks have land holding up-to half km away from the road head. In  total, if we look, around 92 percent of the respondents have land holding away  from road head. This is an important aspect. The farmers have to collect the  produce from the field that are scattered and bring it to the road head via  local transport. Major portion of land that is away from the road head is not  connected to the main road via link road. This increases the problem of the  farmers associated to agriculture production. <strong> </strong></p>
  <p><strong>Transportation Cost: </strong>The land holdings in the  hilly areas are scattered and the distance from the road head is pretty high.  The transportation mainly comprises of two parts (a) local transport and (b)  from road head to APMC. The local transportation is mainly done via two basic  means one is use of labors and second is the use of horse cart. Few farmers  also use their own source of transportation for the local transport. Table  3  gives the detail of different modes of  local transportation in different blocks. </p>

A very less amount of respondents prefer  the use of laborer<u> </u>for transportation purpose as it&rsquo;s an expensive and  time consuming process. The local transport that the farmers undertake is a  costly affair. A huge amount of money is involved in transporting the goods  locally.

  <p align="center"><strong>Table  No: 3</strong><br>
    The average rate charged by the local transporters <strong>(</strong>mainly the horse cart and human labor  that are used by the farmers<strong>)</strong> are  given in the table. The volume that they carry for the transportation varies  from vegetable to vegetable. If we take on an average one Quintal is carried in  every round than it is clear that per kg around 40 to 50 paisa is invested for  the local transportation. More often it make around 45-50 percent of the total  transportation cost. Now the distance travelled is pretty less in this case.  Thus for a smaller distance farmers have to pay a huge price for the  transportation of the vegetables. In  such a long supply chain transportation cost, decreases the profitability of  the farmers. For local transportation in few places there is provision of  ropeways that can connect the farmer&rsquo;s field to the road head. This will reduce  the distance  travelled by the vegetable and also the cost and time. But out of two ropeways  that were seen in Nainital, none was in a working condition forcing farmers to  use the traditional methods of local transportation. The lack of commitment of  local governing bodies and agricultural societies can be seen from this. <br>
    The transportation from road head  to APMC is paid by the farmers. The sources that are available for the farmers  for transportation are local pickups, small trucks and public transport  facility for carrying goods from one place to other. The produce that is coming  from one farmer&rsquo;s field is pretty small. Thus farmers appoint an agent that  collects the produce from the whole village and carry it to APMC Haldwani. <br>
    <strong>Irrigation  Facility </strong><br>
    Availability of water for irrigation plays  an important role in vegetable cultivation. Timely and sufficient quantity of water,  if available,<strong> </strong>enhances the productivity  of the crops. The source of irrigation involves tube wells, water harvesting  tanks, canals etc.  Table 4 gives an idea  about whether land of the farmers has any source of irrigation facility or is  it rain-fed in nature.</p>

  <p><strong>TABLE No. 4</strong><br>
    The table indicates that the irrigated land  that is just 44 percent and rain fed cultivation, that is dependent on rainfall  is 55.79 percent. This shows that majority of the farmers in Nainital district  rely on rainfall for providing water to the crops. Now this is a big problem of  the region. Untimely rains are a common feature. The seeding and  transplantation of the crop depends on the availability of the water for  irrigation. The rainfall, if not timely, affects the sowing of the crops thus  production and productivity of the same. Now with 56 percent of the respondent  depending upon rainfall as a source of water there is a big percentage of  population that depends upon the uncertainties of climate and thus increasing  the chance factor in the production of the vegetables</p>

  <p><strong>Destination of Selling Produce </strong><br>
    The Haldwani APMC has  a sub mandi in Bhowali region of Nainital District. This sub mandi is  established to facilitate the farmers in selling produce in the nearby region.  The other traditional mode of operation that the farmers can use is selling  produce directly in the local market. Now table 5 gives detail of the different  destination chosen by farmers in the traditional value chain.<strong></strong></p>

  <p><strong>TABLE No. 5</strong><br>
    If we look, more than 85 percent  farmers from all the blocks sell their produce to Haldwani mandi and a small  portion of farmers sell the produce in the local market. The usage of Bhowali  Sub-mandi is pretty less. The sub mandi was also visited and a detail study of  it was done. It was identified that the mandi is very less functional. With  only<u> </u>few traders present in the mandi, it&rsquo;s not considered as a viable  option by the farmers of selling the produce. Now the distance of Bhowali Mandi  is much less than that of Haldwani APMC. If the farmers get proper facility in  Bhowali sub-mandi than a huge crunch of the cost that invested by the farmers  in the transportation  can  be saved.<br>
    <strong>Market Availability </strong> <br>
    One of the reasons that forces  farmers to rely on the traditional value chain is the lack of market in the  nearby areas. The government of Uttarakhand has now made it easier for the  farmers for selling the produce outside APMC also. This can boost the chances  of farmers in term of selling the produce directly to organized retail. <br>
    The produce that is  grown in the hilly regions is plenty in quantity and the availability of the  market in the near-by areas is a big problem. To cater to this problem the  concept of &ldquo;Apano Bazaar&rdquo; was started in the region. The set-up was created  near Garampani region of the district where place was provided for farmers,  traders and consumers to come interact and enter into a business transaction. This  due to a lot reasons was a big failure. <strong></strong><br>
    <strong> Lack of  Extension Services/ Information Dissemination </strong>There are a lot government institutes and  NGOs working in the field of agriculture. The basic aim of these organizations  is developing a formidable channel for providing information regarding  cultivation practices, weather information, prices prevailing in the market and  government schemes benefiting the farmers. The ground reality is totally  different. A lot of respondent who participated in focus group interview  pointed out that the basic information that is required by the growers in terms  of cultivation practices and marketing of the produce are not available. The  visit of the agriculture experts is not frequent. Few farmers also pointed out  that many a times they were not provided the information when they contacted  the institutes thus, have to rely on their own knowledge. The farmers also  raised a finger on the working of extension institutes saying they never got  any support from these agencies at time of need. The lacks of knowledge of  sources of finances have made farmers rely more on Arithiyas. A huge number of  the respondents were not aware about different schemes of the government and  other agencies that are beneficial for the farmers. <strong></strong><br>
    <strong>Storage Facility </strong><br>
    The paradox of plenty  is applicable in agricultural commodities. The higher production leads to  higher supply leading to surplus quantity of produce reaching market yards thus  decreasing the average mandi prices.   This is a double edge sword for the farmers. In case everything goes  fine and the production is in plenty than the prices in the mandi will fall  drastically, leading to poor return to the farmers. In case the production is less  due to some reason the per-unit cost of production and transportation will go  high thus leading to more expenses and lesser return for the farmers. For  coping with this paradox of plenty, proper storage facility is required where  farmers can stock their produce after harvesting. The existence of cold  storages for the farmers at village or block level will increase the time value  of the vegetables and will give farmers a chance of selling the produce when  the prices are better in market. But the farmers of Nainital district do not  have access to the cold storage. The farmers because of it do not have a  tendency of holding/ storing the produce. In case the farmers store the produce  they do it in their own homes, where the basic prerequisites required for the  storage are not available leading to loss of quality and quantity of the  produce.<strong></strong></p>
  <h1>finding and Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Present study is conducted to  identify the impact of different infrastructural facilities on the production  and marketing of vegetables. Nainital district on one hand has edge with  respect to growers from other part of the state in term of produce being  off-season produce. But there are a lot of problems associated with the same.  The hilly areas have a scattered and small land holding that stops them for  using the mechanized means of production. The distance of the land holding is  pretty high from the road head. The connectivity of the land to the road head  is also a big problem, thus the local transport, which the farmers undertake  for this selling the produce, is a costly affair. A huge amount of money is  involved in transporting the goods locally. Also it&rsquo;s a  tedious task to carry these vegetables from the farmer&rsquo;s field to road head. In most of the cases the cost of local  transport is more or less than equal to that of main transport. Now this is a  huge amount of cost that the farmer has to bear and it&rsquo;s an added cost apart  from cost of production. Steps must be taken for developing a strong link road system at  village level. This will help in reducing the cost and time involved in local  transport. But due to the hilly topography it&rsquo;s not an easy task to develop such  a strong link road system. Another thing that can be done for enhancing the  effectiveness of transportation is development of ropeway system in the hilly  areas. This will reduce the time and distance that is involved in transporting  vegetables from farm to road head. Proper management of sub mandi and their  development will lead to reduction in the cost of transportation and will give  farmers an opportunity for selling the produce in the nearby areas at a good  price. <br>
    Huge dependence on the rainfall and  lack of availability of irrigation facilities leads to decrease in the output  of the produce. The untimely rain main affect the quality of the vegetables,  thus decreasing the prices of the produce in the market. Government along with other  agencies and NGO&rsquo;s should promote farmers in initiating rainwater harvesting at  village level. This on one hand will reduce chances of landslide and erosion  and on another will help in timely availability of water for irrigation  purpose. Also steps should be taken to enrich the catchment areas of water in  the hilly areas so that surplus water is available for irrigation. <br>
    The reduction in number of intermediaries can  result in lowering the prices of the produce in the market for the customers  and a higher percentage in terms of share for the farmers in the total value  chain. Creation of warehouses at block level will provide a chance to the  farmers for storing the vegetables at warehouse when demand is low and sell it  when the demand is higher in market. This will help in dealing the paradox of  plenty. Co-operative mode can be a way out for developing and maintaining warehouse  at block/ village level. <br>
    Infrastructure is an important aspect of vegetable  production and marketing. The steps discussed above, if taken properly, can  help in enhancing the infrastructural facilities that are required for  production and marketing of the vegetables. This will help in making vegetable  production a profitable business of the farmers. </p>
