  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Credit  in Agriculture is crucial given that majority of the poor in developing  countries are farmers. In the last two decades, development planners have  shifted their focus from supporting large scale capital intensive projects to  meeting the needs of poor people, especially rural communities. Today&rsquo;s attempt  at constructing a development frame-work has seen governments and the private  sector committing huge sums of money into financing the activities of farmers  through microcredit [1]. Some farmers are poor because they cultivate small  areas from which they produce little output and hence sell only a very small  amount, which in turn cannot help in expanding the farm or acquiring new  technology and hence the cycle continues. Credit to small holder farmers can  help in breaking this cycle. Credit is required to purchase improved technology  which is vital for increased output and overall expansion of the farm. Credit  can, however, only help in breaking the poverty cycle if the farmers are aware  of the technology and are capable of using it. Credit has always had a special  place in the mainstream thinking of conventional economic theory [2]. It has  been observed by Etuk [3] that in the 1950s and 1960s, provision of credit was  the key instrument for breaking the vicious cycle of poverty i.e. low savings  and productivity. Admittedly, from early 1970s up to the present time, the  rural poor and small scale farmers have increasingly become the target of  credit provisions especially in the developing countries [4].<br>
    In  an effort to improve the growth and output of Agriculture in Nigeria,  Government initiated many agricultural credit policies and programmes aimed at  improving the credit needs of farmers. The crucial roles agriculture play in  the country&rsquo;s economy, the structure of production wherein the small-holder  dominates, producing 90-95% of total agricultural output, the rate of  increasing urbanization currently being experienced, and policy shift towards  smallholder since 1988 demands repositioning of the sector. This requires  financial boosting as most of the farmers are very poor and inadequate finance  has hindered meaningful development in the sector [5]. In order words, credit  is not a panacea for improved agricultural production. Credit to small farmers  in the absence of the knowledge and use capability of technology can even prove  harmful since the farmers can become heavily indebted and be unable to pay  back. In Nigeria as in the rest of the sub-Saharan Africa, access to financial  services is low and access to credit is much lower [6]. The realization of the  need to tackle the problems of agricultural finance, the Federal Government  (FG) established Nigerian Agricultural and Co- operative Bank now transformed to  Nigerian Agricultural Co-operatives and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB) in  2000. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directed Merchant, Mortgage and  Commercial banks to give credit to farmers at concessionary interest rates to  address the problems militating against agricultural development and finance.  Recently, the Federal Government introduced the Commercial Agricultural Credit  Scheme to provide credit facilities to small holder farmers through  co-operative groups. The government, in 2010 set aside N200 Billion to be  accessed through the CBN in collaboration with participating commercial banks.  However, these measures present a mixed result with farmers raising issues  ranging from retrogressive bureaucracy in processing and disbursement  procedures to lack of organized market for farm produce from loans collected  while the banks allege low rates of repayment by farmers. In the past many  credit agencies were scrapped for gross inefficiency while others were heavily  subsidized in order to keep afloat. This action became necessary because of  high defaults rates among borrowers [7]. Lending institutions are concerned  about risks associated with default. High defaults in many cases above 50% have  been recorded by lending institutions. This study therefore critically examined  the factors that determine credit access and repayment by vegetable farmers in  Niger State. This is because vegetable production has short gestation period  and can be grown in two or three cycles in a year. It also has high  productivity, sales very fast with high cash value. The crop grows well under  irrigation that produces more returns than rain fed. The outcome of the demand  for credit depends on the lending practices of the credit agencies. According  to Anderson [8], credit institutions are concerned with losses from untimely  repayment or default, seek to minimize these by choosing carefully the  distribution of credit across farmers. An investigation into the relationship  between farmers circumstances and characteristics and their receipts or  otherwise of credit may shed light on the factors that influence the lenders  behaviour. Also a number of reasons have been adduced to loan default, little  is known about the effect of socio-economic factors affecting loan repayment  capacity of small scale farmers.</p>
  <h1>methods</h1>
  <p>The study was conducted in Niger State of  Nigeria. The State lies between latitude 80 211 North (N) and 110 301N and  Longitude 30 301E and 70 201E in the North central Geopolitical Zone of  Nigeria. The State is bordered to the North by Zamfara State, to the North-east  by Kebbi State, to the South by Kogi State, to the South-west by Kwara State,  to the West by Benin Republic and Kaduna State and the Federal Capital  Territory (FCT) border the State strategically to the North-east and southeast,  respectively.<br>
    The data for the study was obtained from  primary sources and complemented with secondary. A total of 270 respondents  were selected through multi-stage sampling from the three Agricultural zones of  the State. First stage sampling consists of selection of two Local Government  Areas purposively from each of the three agricultural zones of the State. These  are Gbako &amp; Mokwa in zone I: Chanchaga &amp; Rafi in zone II and Mariga  &amp; Magama in zone III. The second stage involve selection of one extension  block from the Local Government Area followed by the selection of three  extension cell and then finally the fourth stage selection of five vegetable  farmers from each of these cells. Structured interviewed schedule was  administered to collect cross sectional data from the respondents. A total of  240 out of 270 questionnaire administered were returned which represents 89% of  the total. The population for the study was made up of all vegetable farmers in  Niger State with focus on farmers that have benefited from micro-credit from  institutionalized micro-credit agencies. The data for the study was obtained  from a combination of primary and secondary data. The study was conducted using  the structured interview schedule to collect data. The respondents were vegetable  farmers&rsquo; household head. Trained Enumerators from the Niger State Agricultural  Development Project were employed to administer the questionnaire. Statistical  tools used in the analysis of data generated include frequency distribution,  percentages, means, logit and multiple regressions. The socio-economic  characteristics of the respondents were described using descriptive statistics  while the factors that determined access to micro-credit were determined using  equation (1).<br>
    Y = f(X1, X2, X3,  X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, X9,  X10)                  (1)<br>
    Where Y = Amount of micro-credit (access) X1  = Age (in years), X2 = Educational background (No. of years spend on  formal education), X3 = Annual income from farming and non- farm  activities, X4 = Farm size (ha), X5 = Farming status (1  if full time farmer, O if otherwise), X6 = Interest on loan (%), X7  = Gender (1 if male, O otherwise), X8 = Marital status (1 if  married, O otherwise), X9 = Family size (No. of persons), X10  = Extension visit (No of extension visits within the last one year).<br>
    The factors affecting the micro credit  repayment vegetable farmers were determined using the multinomial logistic  model. Multinomial models are appropriate when individuals can choose only one  outcome from among the set of mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive  alternatives. The choice of this method is based on the fact that the level of  loan repayment (dependent variable) is a categorical variable which can take  three (3) levels (those who have completely repaid = 0, those who have paid 50%=1,  and others =2). The probability that the <em>i</em>th  farmer belongs to the <em>j</em>th repayment  group reduces to equation (2) while the generalized multinomial model is  expressed in equation (3) and the probability of being in the base outcome  group is presented in equation (4). Where i = 1,2..n variables k = 0, 1..j  groups and βj = a vector of parameters that relates Xi&rsquo;s  to the probability of being in group j where there are j+1 groups. The various  independent variables included in the final model are X1 = Age of farmer  (years), X2 = Gender (1 = male, 0 = female), X3 =  Household size (no of persons), X4 = Farm size (ha), X5 =  Group membership (1 = participant; 0 = non participant), X6 =  Extension visits (No of extension visit), X7 = Amount of loan  received (N), X8 = Distance from dwelling to the bank (km), X9  = Non-farm occupations (1 = engaged, 0 = not engaged), X10 = Visit  by loan officials (1 if received, 0 if otherwise), X11 = Loan  disbursement lag (time between application and actual loan disbursement) in  months, X12 = Interest on credit (N), X13 = Income from  farming activities.<br>

    To  estimate the model the coefficients of the base outcome are normalized to zero  (0). This is because the probabilities for all the choices must sum up to  unity. Hence, for 3 choices only (3-1) distinct sets of parameters can be  identified and estimated. The natural logarithms of the odd ratio of equations  (2) and (3) give the estimating equation (5). This denotes the relative  probability of each of the other groups to the probability of the base outcome.  The estimated coefficients for each choice therefore reflect the effects of Xi`s  on the likelihood of the farmers choosing that alternative relative to the base  outcome. The estimation was done using Stata Statistical/Data analysis 11.2  software (9). The final estimates were selected based on the variables that  converged during iteration. The coefficients of the base outcome were then  recovered with equation (6) in line with Nmadu, and Peter (10) where β3  = coefficient of the variable of the base outcome (those who have completely  repaid), β1 = estimated coefficient of the 50% repayment group, β2  = estimated coefficient of the others group. In addition, the partial  derivatives or marginal effects and quasi-elasticities of the model were  obtained from the software. Finally, McFadden&rsquo;s (11) likelihood ratio index  (LRI) also known as pseudo R2, similar to the R2 in a  conventional regression, were computed via equation (7) where, lnL =  log-likelihood function, lnL0 = log-likelihood computed with only  the constant term. </p>

  <h2>Socio-economic  and demographic characteristics </h2>
  <p>The Socio-economic and demographic characteristics of  vegetable farmers are presented on Table I. The mean Age of farmers based on  the analysis of field data was found to be 41 years and majority of them are  male (96.25%) and married (99.17%) with average household size of 5. The  average farm plots possessed by the respondents are 2 and the average farm size  is 2.5ha. The distribution revealed that majority of the vegetable farmers were  between the age bracket of 41-50 years of age (53%) in line with similar  findings [12]-[15]. Thus, the bulk of the farmers is therefore still energetic  and should be reasonably enterprising, which a lot of positive implications for<br>

  <h2>Determinants of  Loan Demand</h2>
  <p>The estimates of the determinants of loan demand are  presented on Table III. The R2 was 0.62, indicating the about 62% of  the changes in demand and access for loan was explained by the exploratory  variable and F- ratio was significant at 10%. The results showed that age,  education, annual income, farm size, interest rate and marital status were  significant. Age was positive implying that the older people have more access  to credit than younger ones. This could be attributed to the fact that since  older people tend to be more risk averse, the financial institutions are more  comfortable in dealing with them. Older farmers also tend to adopt more  innovations based on experience garnered from farming; then they will demand  for more farm credit or loan. The level of education attainment could be  interpreted that with higher education, the farmer had the greater potential  for adoption of improved farming technologies and even expand farming  activities which will require more capital, thereby leading to the demand for  higher amount of farm loan. Farm size has a positive contribution to loan  demand implying that farmers with larger farm size will demand higher volume of  loan. Most large scale farmers however own some level of acceptable securities  like life insurance policies, government securities [16]. The analysis also  revealed that interest was negative, attributable to the fact that with higher  the interest rate, the amount of loan demanded will be lowered [17]. Family  size was positive suggesting that larger households might utilize family labour  which helps to reduce labour cost and create avenue for improved efficiency.  There is tendency that more adults in farming household implies more workforces  which might lead to harnessing more capital in order the meet labour cost. It  is important to emphasized that consideration are attached to provision of  tangible assets and not social capital as security for credit by financial institutions  which does not favour small scale farmer because they are deficient in  acceptable collateral. The level of education shows that farmers with some  level of education have high chances of accessing loans than illiterate ones. </p>

  <p>status and years of farming experience  were significant for both groups relative to the base outcome but with different  signs and levels of significance. While gender is negative for the complete  repayment group it is positive for the 50% repayment group relative to the base  outcome. Also, while educational status is significant at 10% level for both  groups, it is negative for the complete repayment and positive for the 50%  repayment group. Years of farming experience is negatively related to loan  repayment at the 10% level for the complete repayment and 1% level for the 50%  repayment groups. According to the results, probability of complete repayment  is reduced by the sex of the respondents while the probability of 50% repayment  group is increased by sex relative to other group. Majority of the respondents  were males hence it appears that among the men, some have repaid 50% of the  loan and while some have completed payment. Table 3 also indicated that the  probability of complete repayment is increased when the respondents have  attained higher educational status. This is hardly surprising as only more  educated farmers would have acquired the knowledge base that is necessary to  understand the nature of credit acquisition and repayment. Household size tends  to reduce the probability of complete repayment in spite of the large family  size. The result here seems to suggest that the third group what is encouraged  by household size tending to contradict the estimate of marital status.  However, the possibility of larger households evading their responsibilities <br>

  <p>such as payment of taxes, levies, fees and  even repayment of credit taken is higher [18]. Years of farming experience  reduces the probability of both complete repayment and 50% repayment, quite  contrary to expectation as it is expected that with growing experience in  farming, the farmer is able to better understand the production technology and  all associated challenges thereby forming models of how to deal with such  challenges intuitively. But with the challenges surrounding the respondents,  particularly the low level of education, experience alone seems inadequate to  guarantee loan repayment.</p>
  <h2>Problems faced  by Vegetable Farmers in Accessing Loans</h2>
  <p>Table V  shows the distribution of farmers according to the problems faced in accessing  credit. The results revealed that 77.9% of the respondents indicated that  collateral is a major obstacle in credit acquisition. Closely related are the  high interest charged (62.50%), payback period (42.9%), delay in processing  loan application (38.75%) and non-granting of amount requested (36.25%)  respectively. </p>
  <h1>Conclusion </h1>
  <p>Repayment capability and capacity of small scale  farmers have remained the greatest challenge in microcredit administration in  Nigeria, mainly bothering on higher default rate. This study investigated the  determinants of loans application and capacity of small scale vegetable farmers  in the study area. The results revealed that vegetable farmers relied more on  informal sources of credit such as friends, relatives, <em>Adashi</em>, money lenders than formal sources. Age, gender, household  size, interest rate and level of education are the main policy variables and  determines the repayment capacity of the respondents. In view of the foregoing,  strengthening the existing credit institutions is required for effective loan  delivery. This will ultimately provide the necessary funds for commercial  production by farmers. In addition, the microfinance institutions should extend  credit to farmers based on need and not solely based on their technical  requirements so as to ensure that the farmers are able to achieve their farm  targets and hence pay back the loan. CBN should compel microfinance institution  to provide loans to farmers and to mitigate the repayments problems, a close  relationship between lender and borrower can be applied through monitoring,  business adviser and regular meetings and supervision. For example, a reward  system for prompt payment could be introduced similar to the credit bay back  programme under the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF). Finally,  the loan disbursement should be done on time so as to avoid diversion to  non-agricultural use. </p>
