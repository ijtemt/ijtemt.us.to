  <p><em>Abstract</em>—The size of a country  and its gross domestic product (GDP) are key indicators that determine the  overall economic strength of a country and/or state. South Africa and Nigeria  are rich in natural resources but with high energy subsidies and a fragmented  tax systems has a larger GDP but overall benefits in social and financial  outlook is little better than Mexico which has a smaller population and lower  GDP than the two countries. This suggests that just like your investment  portfolio a diversified economy is key to success for both developed and  developing countries. We take a look at key indicators that affect overall  financial health and economic stability.<br>

  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>According  to Merriam Webster, the systematic study of the development, structure,  interaction, and collective behavior of organized groups of human beings is the  science of society or is commonly known as sociology. What importance to a  diverse economy does this science have? The economy is the monetary structure  of society or said another way, the mobility, health, and function of people  within a society is determined by the financial structure of a group of people  living within a given radius and proximity to one another. <br>
    One  can agree that there is more than one perspective from which to look at the  economy of a nation, state, country etc. However, I think we all can agree that  these perspectives are developed by looking at the dimensions of any said  community both macroscopically and microscopically within its financial  structure. The layers of such are three-dimensional and help to extrapolate or  expose the cellular bases for a thriving economy within smaller units.</p>
  <h1> Five Components of Society</h1>
  <p>For  the sake of this article we are looking at society being comprised of 5 areas  which are undergirded by financial structure/economy within each community.  Government, Religion, Business/Economics, Education and Family are determining  factors for societal and community health and growth. While the components of  society are not limited to these areas they are commonly acknowledge among  most.<br>
    When  considering economy it is important to understand countries that are considered  developed, developing and those which are under-developed. In many cases they  lack the framework for a consistent revenue structure with which to balance out  export and imports, material and non-material production to balance economy and  national deficit.</p>
  <h1>Diversified Economy and Sustainability</h1>
  <p>Sustainability  can provide additional markets to increase or sustain revenue during a  volatile, sluggish or developing economy. It has been seen in many  international markets that environmental conditions decreases as gross product  increases. This makes since because you are using your natural resources to  mobilize the economy. Decimated and loss of habitat in the continuum can be  counteractive if left unattended. However, if you pair sustainability with  other growing markets it will open up green industries for long-term  investments that can aid in mobilizing the economy. China&rsquo;s economic reform  increased growth but its environment declined. Their government recognized  environmental protection and sustainable economic growth could promote  co-developing of the economy as a national principle. (Naizhuo, Currit, &amp;  Samson, 2011). That is what we&rsquo;re seeing with Brazil&rsquo;s Chevron and their petro  market.  <br>
    Many  are quite aware that you need to diversify your portfolio but are we vigilant  in translating that to our national economies at large for which you live in.  You have to have moderate and no risks investments to help sustain and support  revenue growth juxtaposed to high risk investments. Many call it fiscal  responsibility to managing the economic state of a nation. This was key to  China&rsquo;s reform in how they managed their material productions of agriculture,  manufacturing, electricity and nonmaterial markets of banking and insurance. It  opened up markets for education and research etc… (XU, 2004)<br>
    It  is important to note that an established institution of people in developing  countries much less underdeveloped countries should never have over 33%  investment of revenue in one market by a monopoly to sustain an economy in one  area. Some may even think that percentage is lower. Economist may bring this  figure to task. Which is okay and I even encourage us to look at what a sound  percentage for which to diversify our economies. <br>
    Here  are three examples that support the importance for both developed and  developing countries to vigorously research how resources and investments are  used to support a country.</p>
  <h1>Environmental Sustainability</h1>
  <p>If  habitat destruction occurs without major action a series of domino effects of  symptoms have been observed. If you&rsquo;re lucky you can catch it before you are  thrown into a tailspin. The contrary is neither cost effective nor an economic  burden. Lake Victoria in South Africa was the world&rsquo;s second largest fresh  water lake, home to 400 species of small colorful fish known as cichlids. They  provided wonderful nutrients to the lakes that included protein to the diets of  30 million humans living near the lake (Berg, Hager 2007). However, in the  early 1990s a foreign species, invaded Lake Victoria and wreaked Havoc on its  ecosystem. The 30 Million people using the lake as a food source lost their food  supply. The environmental devastation still continues to be a concern even in  the 21st century. Communities must pose their own environmental questions. Are  we susceptible to these same crises?   Perhaps it isn&rsquo;t fish that supplies both the economy and environment  with what it needs, maybe it&rsquo;s another source. <br>
    Abuja,  the capital of Nigeria is still getting lessons on economic growth despite  being the world&rsquo;s 8th largest oil producer. With a fuel subsidy that offers gas  at a reduced rate inside the country, Nigeria&rsquo;s economy is still yet lethargic  (Lovett, K., Eneh, C., Streams, M. 2012). One might wager a guess that  Nigeria&rsquo;s status as a large oil producer cannot be leveraged because 66% of all  revenue come from petroleum exports in contrast to 90% of oil used inside the  country are imported. Poor revenue structure would have them continually  overcoming a fiscal cliff more often than any nation might desire but could be  abated with a diversified economy. The countries lack of management and public  transparencies due to credible leadership in the area of finance and government  are certainly concerns but not the focal point of this article. Their economy  is an example of why a municipal should not have more than 33% of its stream of  income coming or used as a needed resource coming by one industry as in the  case of Lake Victoria.</p>
  <h1>Implications</h1>
  <p>Uses  of subsidies are intended to lower the tax base or reduce prices of natural  resource products. If this is not balanced well and sell at below market costs  without recapturing these social benefits in the community at large for  extended periods of time, especially in the energy market, you weaken your tax  base, and likely increase propensity toward inflation. In a country such as  Nigeria if you don&rsquo;t diverse the economy you limit overall benefit of the  subsidy and major market becomes volatile because fiscal management hasn&rsquo;t been  achieved. (Koplow, 2008)<br>

    Fig. 1 Gross National Income 2010. (&quot;The World Bank&quot;,  2013)</p>
  <p>The  issue can be seen in developed countries as well. Take the automotive and  manufacturing industry. When General Motors (GM) decided to outsource or close  plants many communities throughout the Midwest and even South were hit by  closing facilities. Notable impacts can be seen in Michigan. General Motors employed  almost 30% of workers in many cities in Genesee County. The result caused a  strike in the early 1990s and a domino effect of loss of jobs which drastically  decreased the population size to what it is now. There may be other factors  that lead to economic change but the size of the employer and percentage of the  number of people it employed was definitely a catalyst. <br>
    These three examples beg the question  of what&rsquo;s a strong economy. An economy that is strengthened is typically  diverse in the industries which make up the workforce and they are one of the  last to enter a recession and have an early exit as well. In the case of a  country or state that is rich in natural resources to which you can attach the  term non-renewable. You have to develop a revenue partner that accounts for the  variability and volatility of not replenishing enough to meet an ongoing  demand. This partner is sustainability and innovative research. <br>
    Take  the fields of India in which there has been catastrophic deforestation of trees  to produce sandalwood. Sustainability becomes a requirement as well as the  ability to replicate or synthesize a similar product. The demand of the  resource provides insight into how viable sustainability and innovation would  be.<br>
    &ldquo;The  world economy is pregnant with multiple equilibria-self-fulfilling outcomes of  pessimism or optimism with major macroeconomics implications. (&ldquo;The World  Economy,&rdquo; 2012). If this is true- than a look at Israel&rsquo;s low inflation and  tight fiscal management is warranted. There is a positive link between their  governmental management and use of the countries natural resources.  Additionally, China&rsquo;s diverse markets and robust economy is a tell-all to  optimism in consumer rich communities that are ripe for testing national markets.  What is interesting about China and Israel is that they have similar population  and GDP that rival much larger countries. They represent the diverse economy  needed to sustain recession and volatile economies.</p>
