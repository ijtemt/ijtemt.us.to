Then it examines the role of  information technology in the tourist sector. The Internet can be a great opportunity for organizations  addressing to eligible consumers in a long term relationship by offering  memorable tourist services, in a perspective of total marketing relationship  that can enhance the physical, emotional, electronics interaction, by integrating  external and internal organizational dimension in order to build customer  loyalty. <br>

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>The tourism organization  is represented by different sectors both on the demand and supply side. It  deals with a dualistic structure (Williams AM, 1995), characterizing by small  firms, such as receptive structures and tourism intermediation, and a few large  companies, such as the air transport case. The reasons engendering the  internationalization of tourism firms are as follows:<br>
    the internationalization of the demand, depending on the one hand by the increase of available  wealth, by the re-consideration of the free time value, and on the other hand  on a greater social mobility and international job mobility and migration  flows;<br>
    the  need for tourism organizations to assert competitiveness through cost leadership,  product differentiation and specialization in particular market niches. All these  factors favour openness towards internationalization.<br>
    The paper examines first the organization of tourist companies, focusing on  the main organizational forms and on human resource management. Then it  examines the role of information technology in the tourist sector. </p>
  <h1>The international organization </h1>
  <p>The tourism organization is represented by a particular competitive context,  structural characteristics and human resource management policies. Tourism  activities are characterized by the need to replicate in foreign markets, with  appropriate adaptations, management tools that would be effective in the  domestic market.<br>
    The essential requirements enabling the tourist organization  to operate in international markets are varied, such as; adequate  decision-making processes; autonomy; efficient reporting, effective  communication channels, constructive career paths, achievement of fixed objectives  (SF Witt, MZ Brooke, PJ Buckley, 1991). In many cases, the first four factors  are considered more carefully in the tourism industry, but all these aspects must  be necessary integrated in the planning of international strategies for their  implication on the choices.<br>
    <em>Decision Making</em> – The decision making process should be based on international  guideline criteria concerning the degree of autonomy recognized by foreign  offices. In fact, if only a limited number of key decisions are taken by the  head office, the international enterprise can be defined decentralized. If too  many other decisions such as small investments and human resource management are  taken from the headquarters, the enterprise is called centralized.<br>
    The centralization of decisions determines  numerous implications such as the ability to have a staff, to make quick  decisions affecting markets in which the company operates, the availability of  effective information flows.<br>
    <em>Autonomy</em> – The  autonomy is defined as the independent authority granted to the foreign office.  The foreign unit is managed according to the legal system of the host country,  in which the administrators take a wide responsibility. In the face of the  acceptance of this responsibility, the standard dispositions relating to  various aspects, such as fiscal and accounting criteria, receive the  appropriate adjustments depending to the local situation.<br>
    <em>Reporting</em> -  The international organization, in order to control the management of foreign  offices, must receive reports containing economic-financial elements, marketing  data and any other statistics useful for units&rsquo; surveys. Monitoring can be  useful to highlight not only management trends, but also possible problems and  to control the responsible behaviour of foreign offices.<br>
    <em>Communication channels</em> - The organizational structure of the international enterprise must be designed  in order to facilitate the information network. In the past, companies adopted vertically  oriented flow of informations between the foreign unit and the headquarters,  trying to simplify as much as possible. In fact, a centralized network requires  a large number of communications because any exchanged information must transit  to the Centre. To cope with these problems a number of methods have been  adopted such as that one providing information exchange cross. This aspect,  which in the past required a minimum of periodicity, is made easier by the  development of communication technologies, enabling to create distance meetings.<br>
    <em>Career paths</em> - In many cases, international tourism companies are composed of human resource  of different nationalities, with specific capabilities and complementary skills.  However, to enhance these resources, it is necessary that career paths are accessible  at the international level too until the head quarter, by providing appropriate  educational supports. This is especially true for companies with a centralized  structure, with the concentration of the most important positions in one  location.<br>
    <em>Objectives</em> -  A useful aspect at the definition of an international organization is the need  to assign objectives being consistent with the overall strategy and able to  stimulate the activities to be carried out. This aspect considers the  expectations of international tourists, interested primarily to receive  standard of reliable services when they choose a well-known brand. However,  there may be cases where local specificities can not be ignored for cultural  reasons, laws, and in these cases it will be necessary to derogate from some of  the rules that the company internationally established. </p>
  <h1>Organizational models in tourism </h1>
  <p>A tourism company operating abroad  must be supported by an adequate organizational design. First, when the  international company makes big investment in the direct management of foreign activities,  the complexity increases and requires significant organization of  decision-making processes and operational procedures. Secondly, the degree of  diversification of the company (if it operates in a single business or in more  different sectors) also affects the need of the design.<br>
    In particular, there are five  organizational forms to meet coordination needs at the international level  (Witt SF, MZ Brooke, PJ Buckley, 1991):<br>
    - <em>The international functional model;</em><br>
    <em>- The international/regional division;</em><br>
    <em>- The international divisions for product/customer;</em><br>
    <em>- The matrix organization;</em><br>
    <em>- The project organization.</em><br>
    <em>The international functional model </em><br>
    Companies operating in a single  business adopt the international functional model, articulated in two  solutions. The first one is characterised by autonomous and more structured  units, in which coordination takes place at top level between the head office  and the foreign office. The second one contains secondary unstructured foreign  units, in which coordination is assigned to a particular functional unit, while  operations are managed by central functions interacting with corresponding  foreign offices.<br>
    <em>The international/regional division</em><br>
    This solution is used both by  companies operating in a single business or in more fields. The responsibility  for internationalization is given to a division of the headquarters, having the  role of coordination of foreign activities or, separately, of one or more  geographical areas.<br>
    The main advantage of this model is  to better coordinate the specialized skills of internationalization, leaving at  the same time wide range of autonomy for the choices concerning foreign assets  (Pencarelli T., 2003).<br>
    <em>The international divisions for product/customer</em><br>
    This model separates the divisions  as autonomous business units, each one relating with the headquarters only at the  top level. It&rsquo;s used especially in multi-product tourist companies or in firms  operating in more sectors, also outside of the tourist market. The basic  criterion is that each division autonomously controls its international activities.  The divisions also can be articulated in a product or customer level, with  foreign offices, each one relating to central offices of division.<br>
    One disadvantage of this form is the  presence of more units belonging to different divisions in the same country.  This problem can be solved by setting up a holding company to coordinate the  accounting, financial and fiscal management.<br>
    <em>The matrix organization</em><br>
    This organizational form enables to  combine divisions by product/customer with divisions by country/region: in this  way the foreign unit refers back to the headquarters in both ways, by allowing  controlling both product/customer and the country, for the benefit of a better  international coordination.<br>
    <em>The project organisation </em><br>
    The project organization consists  of introducing in the organizational structure responsibilities for specific  projects, aimed at managing foreign operations. This solution allows satisfying  the flexibility and structural requirements, which are important in the tourism  sector characterized by a continuous dynamism. The main problem of this form of  organization is to coordinate different working groups dedicated to specific  projects with the main organizational structure, ensuring an effective flow of  information and operational autonomy.</p>
  <h1> Human resource management</h1>
  <p>In tourism, like other service  sectors, it can be registered an increasing attention on entrepreneurial  development at the international level. However, compared to other sectors, it  can be found specific solutions according to company characteristics, the  sector, and the organisational culture.<br>
    The international growth of many  tourism enterprises created imbalances, especially in the selection and  training of personnel with obvious repercussions on the supply quality. In this  regard, it is necessary to distinguish between operational staff and top management.<br>
    In the first case two types of  policies can be adopted: selection and training of local staff of foreign offices,  making the human resource management more uniform at the local level, or  facilitation of the international exchange of experiences through stage or  training courses, with the objective of aligning at international level the human  resource management, favourable condition to use standardized solutions in  personnel management.<br>
    For top management, however, the  cost for the human resources transfer in foreign sites must be added. The costs  for the company can greatly increase, and this drives the company to employ  qualified personnel directly in the foreign country.<br>
    However, in addition to the  acquisition costs of staff, top management and operational one, it is necessary  to consider their capabilities, which must be as consistent as possible with  the organizational culture and values.<br>
    The training is particularly  important in the tourism sector for two reasons (Middleton VTC, 1988):  First, the high number of employees having  direct interaction with clients in all phases of the process-service delivery, differently  from the manufacturing activities where the contact is only at the level of  sales and service.<br>
    The other important factor  is the strategic role of management, because of the increasing competition  within the tourism industry and the consequent need to segment the market. For  example, the mechanism of price differentiation in the tourism (hotels,  airlines) has become more and more complex with respect to the kind of customers.  As a result, management skills are essential to understand the market structure  and dynamics and to define criteria for appropriate segmentation. This  complexity more and more increases if the issues are transferred to the  international level, at the same time keeping coordination with the headquarters.  The development and transferability of capabilities are of great importance in  the international development of the tourism.</p>
  <h1>Information  technology </h1>
  <p>The tourism industry is  characterized by the growing importance in the economic systems both in terms  of employment and creation of added value. All this has a significant effect in  the economy, just think of the workers worldwide was estimated at 68 million  (WTTC-World Travel and Tourism Council).<br>
    The tourism sector over the last  three decades has been among the first sectors that are interested by the use  of information technology: the CRS (Computerized Reservation System) in the  seventies, the GDS (Global Distribution System) in the eighties and Internet in  the mid-nineties. The first two technologies have made available globally  tourist services through the intermediation of travel agencies, which had  exclusive access to automated booking system. Internet, however, extended this  opportunity to the final consumer, redesigning the business system. In fact,  the Internet is not just a tool for information, but also marketing of tourism  products.<br>
    The intrinsic characteristics of  tourism products (intangibility, simultaneity, etc.) are favourably to the use  of network technologies, technologies able to facilitate the collection,  processing and transmission of information within the organization (intranet),  between organizations (extranet) and with (and among) the consumer and with  (and among) corporate stakeholders. They enable many advantages as follows: <br>
    - the cancellation of the  geographical distance making irrelevant the location between producer and  consumer;<br>
    - the increased participation of  tourist in the process of production-delivery of the tourism product through the  acquisition of data, images. <br>
    In fact, the Internet allows to  tourism enterprises to manage in an innovative way:<br>
    - the intangibility, showing in  advance the services they wish, making tangible &ldquo;the intangible&rdquo; (providing  details on the offer);<br>
    - the simultaneity, encouraging the  personalization of the offer and the participation and involvement of the  customer;<br>
    - the heterogeneity, listening to  the opinions of customers and electronic &ldquo;passaparola&rdquo; (chat, forums, etc.);<br>
    - the perish ability, optimizing the  production capacity of enterprises, facilitating access of enterprises, by  orienting the demand to targeted marketing actions.<br>
    Tourists, using internet, look  especially for the speed and completeness of information, which stimulate the  spread of accessible computer technologies, through different media from your  PC, such as cell phones, television sets.<br>
    According to the Between Company  research on network technologies, the propensity of individuals to the use of  the network for the purchase of tourism products is quite high. Another  relevant information is given by the Travel Industry Association of America,  which showed that the number of online travellers has grown tremendously from  2003 to 2006 (from 29 million to 85 million), but only a small part (16  million) make online reservations for obvious security reasons.<br>
    It&rsquo;s possible to draw a typical  profile of the on line traveller: he is a male subject, of middle age, with an  income and a high standard of education, he is oriented toward a resort  tourism.<br>
    It can be registered a relevant  fact, that online sales see first the airlines, followed by tour operators,  online travel agencies, and then the railways, hotels, car rental companies.<br>
    In the booking system used by travel  agencies, there are several intermediaries, such as Worldspan, Sabre, Amadeus,  Galileo. These subjects are in Internet and work at &ldquo;business to business&rdquo; level  along the intermediation chain, and at &ldquo;business to consumer&rdquo; level providing  services to final tourists.<br>
    Also airlines are in Internet and in  electronic commerce, providing various services such as information on  available seats, prices, directly online tickets purchase, by mobile phone, or  by making them available directly at the departure airport at the time of  boarding. They allow consumers to participate in online auctions to purchase  unsold tickets during the day before the flight, getting affordable rates.<br>
    The presence in the network is also  given by the suppliers of rail transport services which made available various  facilities such as simulators path, maps, booking, information. There are also  other organizations in the network such as tour operators, the most innovative  travel agencies, car rental companies, public tourism institutions.<br>
    In a short time we will assist to online  presence of the whole value chain of tourism system due to the Internet's  ability to convey complex information through multimedia tools. The  distribution chain, in particular, will be affected by processes of structural  reorganization. It will record the exit of weakest intermediaries and the entry  of new information intermediaries, such as specialized portals dedicated to  tourism that make re-intermediation processes in the system of tourist value, aim  at improving the cognitive performance of the consumer (Mandelli, 1998) and  offer themselves as mediators between the needs of tourists and the tourism  industry. These portals, in fact, allow visitors to compare the net prices fixed  by different subjects for the same trip, to get personalized 24-hour 24 budgets.  In addition to tourism portals, other subjects are capable of setting up  re-intermediation processes in the tourism sector, such as horizontal portals  in geographical vocation (salernocity.com), search engines (virgilio.it) allowing  to book hotel rooms in major Italian cities.<br>
    Even if many traditional  operators (tour operators, small to medium size hotels) avoid rivalry  downstream of distribution system, by simply providing information to tourists  and orienting the latter towards the agencies for the tourism products purchase,  in the new competitive context, the subject to more risk are travel agencies. Strategies  should be reviewed in light of the aggressive strategies implemented by new actors  of the electronic distribution system, such as air carriers, virtual tour  operators. The same travel agencies could proactively act as strategic actors  in the electronic channel, because they are able to enhance their presence in  the territorial area and to capitalize their cognitive assets towards  customers. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Versus</em> new technologies </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The tourism sector is characterised  by the development of new information and communication technologies, which  enable, by reducing the temporal and spatial distance, to obtain a better  understanding of customer needs and to create custom shapes supply.<br>
    In the supply composition we assist  to the entry of new competitors capable to offer personalized services and the  possible exit of travel agencies. Internet, in any case, enables each organization  to achieve and be reached by the consumer, also many tourist enterprises are  not only present in the network, but thanks to these technologies they have started  effective strategies for Customer Relationship Management (CRM) aimed not only  to acquire customers, but also to retain and establish a lasting relationship  with them. In fact, for many tourism intermediaries and traditional operators  the network is an additional channel adding to the existing ones, based on the brand  reputation, on the acquired image, and on the business strategies adopted in  the past. A hotel, for example, can stimulate its customers to online booking,  simply communicating them the new possibilities.<br>
    New technologies can be able to  address the customer interaction towards the relational exchange model only if  there are two conditions: the high trust between the involved actors, which is  not at all obvious condition and very often to build; and the existence of  non-standard forms to create and communicate the supply. In tourism, however,  there is the delivery of homogenous services (inclusive tour), similar to mass  products with personalized services.<br>
    In order to build and maintain interactive  relationships with customers, it&rsquo;s necessary to start from the mass  customization actions by developing standard models and producing services aligned  to customer needs. As a result it is important to enhance mutual learning  between seller and buyer through:<br>
    - the attention to the technical and  functional quality, recalling the role of contact staff and general staff to  the delivery of total quality, in order to let the customer live a unique  experience and build customer loyalty;<br>
    - the importance of price or power:  in tourism, it becomes less crucial if the actors have a collaborative  relationship, which is not necessarily linked to the technical support with  which they interact;<br>
    - the initial high cognitive  distance between seller and buyer: this occurs especially when the tourist buys  products whose he doesn&rsquo;t have any information and he feels geographically far  (for example the case of the tourist or travel agency organizing the first trip  in central Africa);<br>
    - the availability to cooperate on  both the demand and the supply side, by stimulating the need to activate  relationship marketing initiatives at all organization levels (front office,  back office) and to select target customers interesting to participate at the  process of production-service delivery (Pencarelli T., 2003).<br>
    Electronic transactions don&rsquo;t  necessarily assume the model of relational exchanges or interactive marketing:  Internet produces a range of information and it&rsquo;s necessary for the supply to  communicate what is really important to focus the attention of the demand (Shapiro  C., Varian HR, 2000).<br>
    In addition, although in  distribution channels tourist there are disintermediation and re-intermediation  phenomena, it&rsquo;s not clear the intensity and the future direction of these  phenomena. With regard to the touristic intermediation, it is assumed that  there will be opportunity only for those one able to maximize the cost-benefit ratio  in the purchase of service for each customer. However, the situation of the  actors willing not be able to provide differentiated services to customers is  problematic.<br>
    Focusing on intermediaries such as  travel agencies retailers, it can be said that they can use not only  information and communication technologies to enhance the trust and knowledge  heritage of customers, but also to develop loyalty consumers at the moment of  sale. In fact, agencies have the advantage of being the largest repositories of  social ties and trust with customers, in order to start and maintain a  continuous interaction. Thanks to new technologies, this interaction may be  strengthened but never replaced. Internet represents an opportunity for the  agency to expand the range of offered services, so the agency can make  available one or more computer positions to allow the customers the access to  the network and the purchase of tourism products.<br>
    It will be more and more the  transition from traditional ways to buy purchase forms on the net. If the  Internet is the ideal place for information exchange, products, services, the tourism  will be the sector that will benefit more than any other in economic terms or  not only. In fact, if the technical and economic conditions of accessibility  allow, the Internet will be attended by people who have a high propensity to  use electronic channels, adopting various technological supports such as  computers, cell phone, and television. Thanks to multi-access on the Internet,  the tourist can find all the information he need to plan a holiday, buying  online the expected services. He can choose, for example, last minute offer of  a tour operator or an exotic trip of a specialised broker.<br>
    Furthermore, the competitive  framework will depend on the entrance and persistence of new network operators  in a sector where the financial investment is significant.<br>
    In conclusion, the Internet can be a  great opportunity for organizations addressing to eligible consumers in a long  term relationship by offering memorable tourist services, in a perspective of  total marketing relationship that can enhance the physical, emotional, electronics  interaction, by integrating external and internal organizational dimension in  order to build customer loyalty (De Simone S., 2011a; De Simone 2011b).</p>
