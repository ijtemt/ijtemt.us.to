  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Vegetables are nourishing food because they  contain a little of all the substances man needs: protein, mineral salts,  Sugars, vitamins, Aromatics, colouring agencies, iron and essential oils that  increase man&rsquo;s resistance to diseases. Leafy vegetables no doubt offer  population with limited access to meat and fish rich sources of protein and  some vital micro nutrients needed for healthy living especially in Niger State,  [1]. Consequently, leaf vegetable is now seen worldwide as an ally in the fight  against hidden hunger, [2]. However, most leaf vegetables grown in Nigeria are  annual crops which end their life cycle at the onset of the dry season. This  often results in the scarcity of the commodity during the dry season with the  resultant decrease in protein and certain micro nutrients content of the  general diet especially the poor who are the majority. Nigeria, a tropical  country with most of her land areas lying in low or middle elevation without  frost problem, possesses a favourable climatic condition for all year round  leaf vegetables production. The observed trend among the smallholder farmers is  that, majority of them do rest during the dry season because they are unable to  carry out full scale farming activities [3]. Hence the dry season is a period  characterized by low income especially among this population accompanied by  hunger and malnutrition which sometime lead to the death of children since food  prices are too high [4]. Furthermore, Adeboye and Opabode [5], affirmed that  leafy vegetables are sold at high prices during the dry season in most parts of  the country. The implication of this is that leaf vegetables especially Spinach  production can provide all year round income; generate employment opportunities  for the farmer with little capital investment. In general, leaf vegetable  production can play a vital role in all year round supply of balanced diet,  conservation of natural resources and improved farm income [6]. Having been  made aware of the enormous benefits inherent in the dry season leaf vegetable  production coupled with the introduction of Fadama farming programmes (a world  bank grant sponsored agricultural development programme) fashioned to help the  production of vegetable and maize during the off season.<br>
    Irrigation  development in Niger State indicated that Niger state has a total irrigation  land area of 682,331 ha, of which only 105,556 ha is put to use and it is  estimated that about 120,000 ha can be developed through harnessing of  sub-surface water using wash bores or tube wells while the balance can be  developed using rivers diversion modules, flood control structures and surface  pumping [1]. The extensive flood plains at the southern boundaries of the  state, availability of large water bodies (river Niger, Kaduna, Gbakogi, Gurara  and Chanchaga), dams/reservoirs (Kainji, Shiroro and Jebba), numerous streams  as well as the distinct six months of dry weather offer great opportunity for  dry season cultivation of rice, sugarcane, maize, pulses and assorted  vegetables. Only about 25% of the potential irrigation land in the state has  been developed. These include small irrigation structures established by the  ADP such as wash bores, tube wells, and diversion modules. Niger State  Government provided medium scale irrigation schemes (800ha) located at Rabba,  Chanchaga, Zara, Lioji, Edo, Lapai, Agaie, and Guzan while the Federal  Government of Nigeria provided 22,000ha located at Tungan Kawo, Swashi, Auna  and Kagara [1]. More farmers are now participating in dry season leaf vegetable  production in Niger State [7]. It was against this background that this study  was conceived to ascertain Farm-specific factors affecting the level of profit  efficiency of the smallholder Amaranth farmers under irrigation agriculture. </p>
  <h1>methods</h1>
  <p>The study was conducted in Niger  State which lies between latitudes 9°35ˈ-9°40ˈN and longitudes 6°30ˈ-6°35ˈE  with a population of 4m [8], 80% of which live in the rural areas and  subsistence agriculture accounts for 70% of the total employment [1]. It is  estimated 400,000 farming families exist in the State holding an average 3.5ha  farm plots. According to Aminu [7], the State is the largest in the federation  in terms of land mass, covering 9.3% of total land area of the country  i.e. about 86,000sqkm or 8.6 million hectares  and 80% of which is arable.<strong></strong><br>
    The study was conducted in the  predominantly vegetable producing areas of Niger State. The study adopted  multi-stage random sampling techniques. The State consists of three  Agricultural Development Project (ADP) zones, namely, Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone  3. Two local government areas were selected randomly from each of the Zones  from where two communities involved in intensive vegetable production were  randomly selected. Finally, 20 spinach farmers were also randomly selected from  each of the selected communities giving a total of 240 respondents for the  study. <br>
    Data for this study were sourced  from primary sources. The primary data were elicited from respondents with the  used of structured questionnaire complimented with interview schedules. Data  were collected on the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents such  as: age, sex, family size, and level of education, input-output data such as  farm size, labour requirement by operation, and depreciation on capital inputs  such as cutlasses, hoes, irrigation machine, knapsack sprayer and quantity of  spinach produced. Relevant information were elicited from the respondents on  other production inputs such as fertilizer, agrochemicals, improved seeds,  hectares devoted to spinach production, input-output prices.<br>
    The analytical techniques used in this study include stochastic frontier  profit in line with Ojo <em>et al.</em> [9] and Oguniyi [10], who adopted Battesse and Coelli [11] model to postulate a  profit function which is assumed to behave in a manner consistent with the  stochastic frontier concept. The profit frontier model begins by considering a  stochastic profit function with a multiplicative disturbance term of the form  in equation (1).</p>
  <p>π = f(pi, Zikβi)e(Ei)  ------------------------------------------(1)<br>
    Where; π= normalized profit defined as gross revenue  less variable cost divided by price of output, Pi = normalized price  of variable inputs by the farm divided by output price, Zi = level  of kth fixed factor on the farm, βi = vectors of parameters, ei  = error term used, Ei = stochastic disturbance term consisting of  two independent elements v and u.<br>
    Where, Ei = Vi + Ui  ---------------------------------------------(2)<br>
    Vi&rsquo; is NID(0, δ2) while Ui  is the one-sided disturbance form used to represent profit inefficiency and it  is independent of Vi.<br>
    The stochastic profit function model can be used to  analyse cross-sectional data. The model simultaneously estimates the individual  profit efficiency of the respondents as well as the determinants of the profit  efficiency. The frontier of the farm is given by combining equation 1 and 2 as  presented in equation (3).<br>
    π = f (Pi,Zik,β) e(U+V)  --------------------------------(3)<br>
    Profit efficiency of an individual farmer is defined  as the ratio of predicted actual profit to the predicted maximum profit for a  best practical vegetable farmer and this represented in equation (4).<br>
    Profit efficiency (Eπ) =<img src="Profit_Efficiency_of_Smallholder_clip_image002.gif" alt="Profit Efficiency of Smallholder Spinach Producers under Irrigated Agriculture In Niger State, Nigeria" width="243" height="30">------------(4)<br>
    Where π = predicted actual profit πmax  =predicted maximum profit<br>
    Given the density function of Ui and Vi,  the frontier profit function can be estimated by the maximum likelihood  technique. E(π) takes the value between o and 1. If Ui = 0 i.e.  lying on the frontier, the farmer has potential maximum profit given the price  it faces and level of fixed factors while if Ui &gt; 0, the farm is inefficient  and operates on lower profit as a result of inefficiency. Following, Coelli  [12] and Ojo <em>et.al</em> [9], the  stochastic frontier function with behavioural inefficiency components was used  to estimate all parameters together in one step maximum likelihood estimation  procedure. The explicit Cobb-Douglass functional form the <em>Amaranth </em>producers in the study area was therefore specified  explicitly as presented in equation (5).</p>
  <p align="left">Lnπ = lnβo+lnβ1Z1i+lnβ2iP1i+lnβ3iP2i+lnβ4iP3i+lnβ5iP4i+  lnβ6iP5i+lnβ7iZ2i+(V-U)-----------(5)<br>
    Where π = normalized profit function computed as the  total revenue less variable cost per output price, Zi =farm size  (ha), P1= Normalized price of labour (price (N) per man-day of labour), P2= Normalised price of  fertilizer (price (N) per kg of  fertilizer), P3= Normalized price of seed (price (N) per kg of seed), P4=Normalized  price of agrochemical [price (N) per  litre of agro-chemical], P5=Normalized price of irrigation water  (cost of irrigation water (N)/litre), Z2=Annual  depreciation on farm tools, βO=Intercept/constant, β1-β7=Parameters  to be estimated, Ui=Non-negative (zero mean and constant variance)  random variable called profit inefficiency effect associated with the profit  efficiency of the ith farmers. Uij&rsquo;s are the profit inefficiency  effects which are assumed to be independent of Vij&rsquo;s such that Uijs  are the non-negative truncation (at zero) of the normal distribution with mean  Ui and variance (δ2V). Where Ui is defined as shown in equation (6).</p>
  <p>Ui = δ0+δ1Gi+δ2G2i+δ3G3i+δ4G4i+δ5G5i+δ6G6i+δ7G7i+δ8G8i---6</p>
  <p>Where, Ui = profit inefficiency of the ith  farmer, G1i = Age of the ith farmer (in years), G2i  = Level of education of the ith farmer (number of years spent in  school), G3i = Farming experience of the ith  farmer (in years), G4i = household  size of the ith farmer (number), G5i = Extension contact  (number of meeting during production process), G6i = Sex (1 for  male, 0 for female), G7i = Credit status of the ith  farmer (1 for access to credit, 0 otherwise), G8i = Status of  Membership of the co-operative society of the ith farmer (dummy  variable, whereby, 1 for membership,  0 for otherwise). δ1-δ8=unknown  parameters to be estimated. The parameters of the stochastic frontier profit  function were estimated with FRONTIER version 4.1c [12]. </p>
  <h1>results and discussion</h1>
  <p>The results of the analysis and the discussion of the  results are presented in this section.</p>
  <h2>Socio-economic and demographic factors </h2>
  <p>The socio-economic and demographic characteristics of  the respondents are presented on Table I The results on show that majority  (93.7%) were males with the mean age of the respondents was 40 years and  majority of the farmers (40%) were between 41-50 years indicating that  relatively younger persons are involved in production system and therefore  there is likelihood increasing productivity which corroborates earlier findings  [13] - [14]. Apart from increase in labour supply, respondents within the  productive age bracket are likely to adopt innovation more than the aged  farmers [15]. The cultural setting of the area that allows for  gender-stereotype access to production inputs especially land had been  indicated [16] - [17]. It has also observed that female gender at individual,  household and wider community and national contexts are affected by financial,  economic, political and legal obstacles while at the same time, strengthens the  male farmers access to inputs [18] - [19]. The average household size was about  10 persons. While high household size could be an incentive for increased land  cultivation (especially where all members are adult and participate in farming  activities), this result shows a contrary situation among spinach farmers in  the study area where lands cultivated were small [20] - [21]. The results also  show that spinach producers under irrigated agriculture in Niger State are  generally smallholder farmers probably because of the limited availability of  irrigable land relative to total cultivable land and constraints imposed by  land fragmentation [22] - [23]. The result also corroborates earlier findings  [20]. They affirmed that the small farm size could be because these farmers  also engage in other activities such as rain fed agriculture, fishing,  marketing etc. which equally demand for their limited labour.</p>
  <h2>Estimates of the Stochastic Profit Frontier Function </h2>
  <p>The  maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the stochastic profit  frontier model are presented on Table II. The diagnostic statistics showed that  the estimated sigma-squared (δ2) is significant at the 5% level.  This indicated a good fit and the correctness of the specified distributional  assumptions of the composite error term. The observed significance of δ2  conformed to earlier findings [9], [22], [24] – [25]. They concluded that  conventional production function is not an adequate representation of the data.  In addition the estimated gamma (ϒ) of 0.989 which is the ratio of the variance  of farm specific profit efficiency to the total variance of the profit was  significant at the 1% level of significance as indicted in Table II, indicating  that 98.9% of the variation in actual profit from maximum profit (profit  frontier) among spinach farms was due mainly to differences in farmers&rsquo;  practices, one sided error and </p>

  <p>therefore 1.1% was due to stochastic disturbance with two sided  error, supported by high t-value [26]. Out of the seven variables modeled, only  the coefficient of Farm size was positive and significant. This implies that if  farm size is increased by 1%, holding other variables constant, farm profit  will increase by 0.744%, i.e. decreasing returns to scale, while normalized  costs of fertilizer, agrochemical and farm tools have negative coefficients and  are significant. This implies that a 1.0% increase in fertilizer, agrochemical  and farm tools would lead to decrease in profit efficiency by 0.169, 0.222 and </p>

  <p>0.195 respectively i.e. decreasing return to scale. The normalized  cost of fertilizer is negative and significant at 1% level of significance.  This shows that an increase in the amount spent on this variable led to a  decrease in the profit efficiency of the spinach farmers. This suggests an over  use of the fertilizer to the point of diminishing returns. Agrochemical was  also found to be negative and significant at 10% level. This indicates that as  the cost of agrochemical increases, profit of the farmer also decreases. It may  perhaps be due to wrong use leading to too much application of agrochemical  resulting in extra cost sustained by the spinach farmers. Farm tools had a  significant but negative relationship with the profit of the spinach farmers.  The Table also shows that normalized cost of labour, planting seed and irrigation  water were not significant. </p>
  <h2>Determinants of Profit Inefficiency </h2>
  <p>The parameter estimates for the determinants of profit inefficiency are  also presented on Table II. The results of the analysis of inefficiency models  shows that education had a negative coefficient and significant at 10%, farming  experience, extension contact and sex of respondents also had a negative  coefficients respectively and are all significant at 5%  level respectively. This means that as these  variables increases, the profit inefficiency of the Spinach farmer decreases.  The results also showed that the spinach farmers with high level of education  coupled with better farming experience exhibited significantly less loss of  profit than those with little education and little experience which are  inconsistent with earlier findings [25] &amp; [27]. Age had a positive  coefficient and significant at 5% significant level. This implies that as the  farmers&rsquo; age increases the profit inefficiency of the farmer also increases,  quite contrary to theoretical expectations. It was expected that farmers will  gain from experience and have opportunity to correct observed errors of the  past. Since this was not the case, there seems to be memory lost or farmers are  adamant and inflexible in their plans. </p>
  <h2>Efficiency indices of the respondents </h2>
  <p>The  distribution of profit efficiency of small holder spinach farmers is presented  in Table 3. The profit efficiency ranged between 0.0093 and 0.9011 for the  worst and best-practice farmer respectively and with mean profit efficiency in  the study area of 0.4450. This implies that the average spinach farmer in the  study area could increase profit by 55.5% by improving his/her technical and  allocative efficiencies. This implies that there exist prospects for the  farmers to increase their farm incomes thus reducing poverty. The wide  variation in profit efficiency is not surprising and was similar to the results  from other studies. For example Adeleke, <em>et  al.</em> (25) reported a mean profit efficiency level of 0.422 (0.05- 0.99) for small  holders farmers in Atiba Local Government Area of Oyo State; Ohajianya (27)  reported a mean profit efficiency of 0.32 for cocoyam producers in Nigeria;  Rahman (24) reported a mean profit efficiency level of 0.77 ranges for  Bangladesh rice farmer;. Oguniyi (10) reported a mean profit efficiency level  of 0.12 (0.000187-0.429) for cocoyam producers in Osun State. The low level of  profit efficiency observed was as a result of marked mal-allocation of existing  resources. In other words, the farmers did not optimally allocate existing  resources to necessitate the attainment frontier profits. Even the  best-practice farmer requires a cost saving to operate optimally.</p>
  <h2>Constraints  faced by spinach producers</h2>
  <p>The distributions of the constraints  encountered are presented on Table IV. Results indicated that lack of  agrochemical is the most important constraint faced by the spinach farmers  interviewed. The lack may be associated with high cost or shortage of supply.  So it is hardly surprising that lack of funds is one of the major production  constraints encountered by the respondents. This is probably due to cash  trapped nature of small scale farmers in rural communities especially in developing  countries like Nigeria, since cash is necessary for the purchase of inputs and  other equipment which are normally associated with improved technology [28].  High cost of inputs is the next important constraint but bears close  relationship with the earlier ones and shortage in supply of the inputs or the  long marketing chain before the inputs gets to the farmers [28]. High costs of  labour is also a major constraint, this could be due to shortage accentuated by  migration from farms to towns and cities in search of more comfortable jobs or  due to high demand at certain critical stages of farm operations. Lack of farmers&rsquo;  co-operatives or farmers associations was also one of the problems encountered.  Effective farmers&rsquo; association has been very useful in microcredit management  and is a source of coercion and persuasion for farmers to adopt innovations and  improved technologies in a band wagon manner [e.g. 28]. Some of the respondents indicated  that the improved technology was too complex for adoption, this shows that the  extension workers <br>

  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
  <p>This study investigated the  determinants of spinach production and factors affecting profit efficiency of  the respondents. Spinach production was found to be profitable enterprise in  the study area and farm size was significant at explaining the profit  efficiency of the farmers. The results show that the farmers are generally  profit efficient but can improve on it by up to 55.5%. The major problems  encountered by the farmers in spinach production include lack of agrochemicals,  lack of funds, high cost of labour and improve technology being too complex for  them. In view of these, fertilizer should be made available to the farmers by  both private and public sectors at affordable rate. There may be need to  sustain the subsidy policy within the current e-wallet system and ensure proper  monitoring to ensure that the input gets to the intended beneficiaries. In  addition, Extension agents should be adequately trained on improved practices;  this will go a long way to facilitate the training of farmers on utilization of  these inputs. Also, there is the need to encourage practicing and prospective  entrants into spinach business by making production inputs available and  opening up government land to practicing farmers. This will boost production,  curb wide spread of poverty, create employment and improve the standard of  living of the citizenry. Finally, credit policy should be expanded to enable  farmers have access to credits. Government and private stakeholders should  invest more on operational credit institutions with thorough supervision and  monitoring to ensure that such credits gets to the target farmers.</p>
