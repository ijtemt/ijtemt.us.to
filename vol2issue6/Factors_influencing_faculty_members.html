  <p><em>Abstract- </em>Faculty members underutilize the Learning  Management System (LMS), a web-based based technology intended to facilitate  student learning, despite the ubiquitous presence of the system at many  universities. Drawing from Davis&rsquo;s (1989) Technology  Acceptance Model (TAM), this study identifies how faculty attitudes toward the LMS  impact their adoption of this technology. The study focuses on a specific LMS, Blackboard.  Thirty-six faculty members were invited to complete a web-based survey.  Directive content analysis was utilized to analyze and interpret the survey  responses. The study reveals that specific challenges including system problems  and design flaws reduce the overall utilization of the LMS by faculty. Recommendations  about how to increase the utilization of Blackboard among faculty members are  included. <br>

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>Currently, tens to hundreds of thousands  of dollars are invested on Learning Management Systems (LMSs) by educational  institutions, in order to facilitate the teaching-learning activities (O&rsquo;Leonard  &amp; Bersin, 2006). LMS is a self-contained webpage with embedded  instructional tools that allow faculty to organize academic content and engage  students in their learning (Laster, 2005). The utilization of this web-based technology  enables instructors to create and deliver content, monitor student  participation, and assess student performance. The LMS utilizes synchronous and  asynchronous technologies to facilitate access to learning materials and  administration (Black, Beck, Dawson, Jinks &amp; Meredith, 2007). Provided that  universities make a considerable investment in the LMS, it is important to  ensure that end-users, especially faculty members, adopt the technology that is  readily available. <br>
    Prior research indicates that LMSs are available  across a number of universities and colleges; where upwards of 90% of all  institutions have purchased rights to this technology (e.g., Hawkins &amp;  Rudy, 2007). Through the use of the LMS (e.g.,WebCT, Learn.com, KrawlerLMS,  Joompla LMS, ATutor, Blackboard, and Canvas), higher education institutions  offer multiple learning environments including: interactive learning, online  learning, distance learning, or hybrid/ blended learning for their students  (Falvo &amp; Johnson, 2007, Vovides, Sanchez-Alonso, Mitropoulou, &amp; Nickmans, 2007). Despite widespread availability, prior research suggests the LMS  is a powerful technology that has yet to reach its full potential (Watson &amp;  Watson, 2007) across educational institutions. <br>
    Various issues are currently impeding the  comprehensive utilization of the LMS. As an example, many instructors use the LMS  simply as a delivery mechanism for the students (e.g., posting grades), and  they do not use the integrated functionalities (Garrote, &amp; Pettersson, 2007,  Vovides et. al., 2007). Prior research has found the LMS features including discussion  forums, chat, and email are underutilized by teachers and students (Nelson, 2003,  Garrote &amp; Pettersson, 2007). In addition, Weaver, Spratt and Nair (2008)  found that faculty members perceive an increased workload associated with using  the LMS. Specifically, their study revealed that 70% of faculty experience challenges  with the software and received limited technical support when they attempted to  include the LMS technology within their courses. Garrote and Pettersson (2007)  noted that lack of motivation to spend the necessary time and effort to learn  and participate in the LMS training, is among the more common restricting  factor in the utilization of the LMS by the faculty members. Finally, most universities do not require faculty members to utilize  the LMS, despite the considerable financial investment.  Since it appears the availability of the LMS  does not predict utilization of the system by faculty members, this paper seeks  to discover the following: (a) gain a better understanding of the extent to  which faculty members utilize the LMS for teaching, (b) identify faculty  members attitudinal patterns toward the LMS and the factors that impact their  attitudes, (c) identify the strengths and weaknesses of the LMS, and (d) summarize  the recommendations faculty members made about how to increase the utilization  of Blackboard. The specific LMS studied in this paper is, Blackboard. <br>
    The slow adoption of the LMS by faculty  members is a critical concern since they are the key users. However, a recent  literature review completed by the authors reveals that few studies focus on  faculty attitudes toward the LMS (e.g. Liaw, Huang &amp; Chen, 2007,  Samarawichkrem &amp; Stacey, 2007, Ball &amp; Levy, 2008, Weaver et. al., 2008),  whereas most studies focus on students&rsquo; attitudes. As a result, this study  contributes to research by considering and analyzing faculty attitudes toward  LMS. <br>
    In order to gain an understanding of the  LMS utilization across faculty members, this article draws from Davis&rsquo;(1989)  Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to identify <strong><u>how</u></strong> faculty attitudes toward LMS impacts their adoption, and  subsequent utilization of the system. Based on the TAM framework, this study  examines the nature of faculty attitudes under conditions of non-mandatory use  of technology. A content analysis of open-ended data using the TAM framework  was completed for this study. It does not appear that this methodology has been  used in previous studies. In order to gain a better understanding of <strong><u>why</u></strong> faculty members utilize or  choose not to utilize Blackboard, we explore several factors including the  identification of the strengths and weaknesses of LMS (Blackboard) from the perspectives  of faculty members. Also, data was gathered that allowed the authors to gain  insight from faculty members regarding the initiatives that can be taken to  ensure improved acceptance of Blackboard.   Finally, a recent meta-analysis that incorporated the TAM model (Lee,Kozar  &amp; Larsen, 2003), reported that out of 101 studies only three utilized  qualitative research methodology to analyze data. In summary, this paper makes three  contributions: (a) it focuses on faculty utilization of LMS, in lieu of student  utilization,    (b) it investigates <strong><u>why</u></strong> faculty members do not utilize LMS despite the availability,  and (c) it uses a qualitative methodology; where most previous studies on LMS have  been quantitative in nature. <br>
    In the next section of the paper, we  discuss the current literature related to LMS, and we describe the constructs  included in the TAM model. We then describe how the study was conducted,  including a description of the sample population. Next the key research  findings are presented. The article closes with a set of recommendations  regarding how to increase the utilization of a specific LMS: Blackboard, among  faculty members. </p>
  <h1>Theoretical Framework</h1>
  <h2>Learning Management Systems (LMS)</h2>
  <p>Previous LMS studies have mainly focused  on three areas: (a) comparative analyses of LMS (i.e.Beatty &amp; Ulasewicz,  2006, Carriere, Challborn &amp; Moore, 2005, Black et.al, 2007), (b) issues  related to the functions and features of LMS (i.e. Barron &amp; Lyskawa 2001,  Landon, 2007), or (c) the extraction of LMS evaluation criteria, (i.e. Kim  &amp; Leet, 2008, Samarawickrema &amp; Stacey, 2007).  For example, Weaver et. al., (2008) surveyed  students and faculty about the LMS use, and found that system quality is important  to both the students and faculty. Their study revealed that students pay  attention to the design, resourcefulness, and good interaction capacity of LMS.  In comparison, faculty members are more interested in the technical and  administrative aspects of LMS. Gautreau (2011) cited the previous studies of  Ayers and Doherty (2003), Jafari, McGee, and Carmean (2006), and Oliva and  Pawlas (2005), and reported that:<br>
    &ldquo;LMS may assist faculty with managing courses  and organizing content to engage students and decrease planning time, thus  supporting the instructional process. Despite the benefits of incorporating an  LMS, many faculty members do not adopt technology as a teaching tool.&rdquo; (p.2) <br>
    The current study leverages the TAM framework and identified the  factors that impacted the faculty members&rsquo; attitudes toward using  Blackboard.  </p>
  <h2>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</h2>
  <p>Although there are other theories that can  be used to explain technology adoption, the TAM model was included in this  study for the following reasons. First, TAM is the most influential framework  used to predict the technology adoption behavior of users (Davis, Bagozzi,  &amp; Warsaw, 1989, Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000, Lee, et.al., 2003, Venkatesh  &amp; Bala, 2008). TAM has been applied to explain or predict individual  behaviors across a broad range of end-user computing technology, and user  groups (Davis, et al., 1989).  TAM  provides a quick and inexpensive way to gather general information about  individuals&rsquo; attitudes toward a system, and it can be used to measure general  levels of satisfaction of users with diverse interests (Mathieson, 1991). Finally,  prior research has found TAM is empirically strong and powerful (Lee et.al,  2003), parsimonious (Davis et.al., 1989), and the model most often applied to  study information technology adoption/utilization (Davis et al., 1989,  Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000, Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008). In addition, TAM was  useful in describing the user&rsquo;s technological adoption behavior in different  environmental settings. <br>
    TAM assumes that an individual&rsquo;s  technological acceptance behavior is determined by a number of factors. Two  major factors are Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness  (PU).  PEOU is defined as &ldquo;the degree to which the prospective user  expects the target system to be free of effort&rdquo; (Davis et.al 1989, p. 985). The construct reflects the amount of effort  that would be required relative to the person&rsquo;s perceived capabilities. For  example, the PEOU of Blackboard reflects the degree to which a faculty member  believes that Blackboard is easy to use. PU is defined as the user&rsquo;s  &ldquo;subjective probability that using a specific application system will increase  his or her job performance within an organizational context&rdquo; (Davis, et  al., 1989, p.985).  For example, PU is the degree to which a  faculty member believes that using Blackboard would make his/ her academic work  easier, and would facilitate his academics activities. As depicted in  Figure 1, Davis found a causal influence of &ldquo;perceived ease of use&rdquo; of the  technology on &ldquo;perceived usefulness&rdquo; of the technology. <br>
    <img width="277" height="110" src="Factors_influencing_faculty_members_clip_image002_0000.jpg" alt="Factors Influencing Faculty Members’ Learning Management Systems Adoption Behavior: An Analysis Using The Technology Acceptance Model"></p>
  <p>Figure  1. <em>Technology  Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989)</em></p>
  <p>This inference suggests the faculty member&rsquo;s perceptions of the  technology will positively influence their attitude towards the  technology.  Also, according to TAM if  users find a technology useful to them, they will develop positive attitudes  toward the technology, which will shape their intentions to use the technology.  Therefore, if faculty members find Blackboard useful to them (e.g., it helps  them manage assignments given to students), they will develop positive attitudes  toward it, which will shape their intentions to use it. <br>
    After the PEOU and PU constructs, the next  construct that is present in the TAM model is Attitude Towards Using (ATT). The  construct is defined as &ldquo;an individual's  positive or negative feeling about performing the target behavior (e.g., using  a system)&rdquo; (Davis et.al. 1989, p. 984). The construct ATT postulates that to the extent that faculty  members perceive the technology is easy to use and helpful, they will have positive  attitudes about the technology. Further, TAM postulates that the faculty  members&rsquo; positive or negative attitudes toward using Blackboard are directly  impacted by their perceptions of the usefulness (PU) and ease of use (PEOU) of  Blackboard. In other words, to the extent that a faculty member perceives  Blackboard easy to use and useful, he/she will have a positive attitude (ATT)  towards using it. The fourth construct in the TAM model: Behavioral Intention  (BI) is defined as the degree to which  a person has formulated conscious plans to perform, or not perform some  specified future behavior (Davis, 1989). In other words, this construct  measures the end-user&rsquo;s intention, which is directly influenced by ATT, that is,  the attitude towards the technology. As it relates to Blackboard, BI states the  conscious intentions of the faculty members to use or not the technology. It  has been found in previous research that BI is the strongest predictor  of actual use (AU) of the technology (Davis, et al., 1989).  Specifically, BI has been found to be a valid  predictor of AU, especially when the use of the technology is voluntary  (Venkatesh, et. al., 2003).</p>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <h2>Participants</h2>
  <p>The participants in the study consisted of  individuals with teaching responsibility, that is, faculty members and graduate  teaching assistants at a large Southeastern university. Blackboard was adopted  as the LMS by the university in Fall 2004; however it was not mandatory for all  faculty members to utilize Blackboard. They had the flexibility to use none,  some, or all of the available features within Blackboard. In addition, faculty  members had the option to utilize other software over and beyond Blackboard.  The setting in which the data was collected was ideal since faculty were not  mandated to utilize Blackboard. The university had an information technology  office which offered various Blackboard training sessions to the instructors,  at no additional fee. However, it was not mandatory for the faculty members to  attend the training.   <br>
    A convenience sample of five colleges at  the university was selected, and a total of 100 individuals with teaching  responsibility (e.g., faculty, instructors, graduate students) were invited to  participate in an electronic survey. The five colleges included: College of  Education, College of Business, College of Engineering, College of Science and  Mathematics, and College of Human Sciences.   These colleges were selected as one or both of the co-authors knew  individuals that had teaching responsibility during the semester data was  collected. No identifiable information was collected from the respondents.  Survey participation was voluntary and anonymous. No incentives were offered to  the potential respondents to fill in the survey. <br>
    Thirty six individuals with teaching  responsibility completed the survey. The survey response rate of 36% was fairly  consistent with the average survey response rate of several of the studies  (that used web-surveys for data collection) included in a meta-analysis  conducted by Cook, Heath, and Thompson (2000).   In that review, the average response rate was reported at 34.6%. <br>
    The demographics of the individuals that  participated in this study included: 17 males (47%) and 19 females (53%),  between the ages of 27 to 75 years old.   Related to &ldquo;types of teaching responsibility&rdquo;, there were five (14%) professors,  12 (33%) associate professors, 13 (36%) assistant professors, three (8%) instructors,  and three (8%) graduate teaching assistants. Specific to disciplines, 12 (33%)  of the respondents were from the College of Education, 11 (31%) were from the  College of Business, eight (22%) were from the College of Engineering, four  (11%) were from the College of Science and Mathematics, and one (3%) respondent  was from the College of Human Sciences. </p>
  <h2>Survey</h2>
  <p>The respondents completed a survey that  included a total of twelve questions. The questions were specifically developed  by the authors for the study. <br>
    The first two questions in the survey were  both closed-ended. Specifically, the first questions asked the survey  respondent to identify the types of courses where Blackboard is used (e.g.  online, on-campus, hybrid). The respondents were given an option of stating  that they did not use Blackboard in their courses.  The second questions ask the faculty members  that indicated they used Blackboard in question 1, to identify the features  they used on Blackboard. (e.g., gradebook, chat room, discussion board).<br>
    The next six questions were open-ended and  asked the respondents to share their perceptions of Blackboard. These non-directive  questions were included in the survey to ensure that the responses were  relatively broad (Hammersley &amp; Atikson, 1983). The respondents were  provided unlimited space in the reply text boxes to allow the opportunity for  unconstrained replies. The specific questions were:  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify  the three main reasons you are or not using Blackboard for teaching purposes.</li>
    <li>Describe  the extent to which you perceive Blackboard to be clear and understandable. </li>
    <li>Describe  the level of skills that are required to use Blackboard.</li>
    <li>What  are the strengths of Blackboard?</li>
    <li>What  are the weaknesses of Blackboard?</li>
    <li>What  would you recommend to improve or modify in Blackboard to ensure more usability  and acceptance?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The last four questions of the survey were  used to collect demographic information (e.g. age, gender, academic rank and  college). </p>
  <h1>Research strategy</h1>
  <p>The study conducted a content analysis  (Krippendorff, 2004) in order to analyze the open-ended data collected across  the survey respondents. Of the three types of content analysis (conventional,  directed and summative) that exist, the directive content analysis (Hsieh &amp;  Shannon, 2005) approach was utilized. The directive content analysis approach  begins with a predefined theory (i.e., TAM). Next, codes are defined before and  during data analysis.  Finally, codes are  derived from theory or relevant research findings (i.e., in our case, codes are  derived from theory) (Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005).  Using the content analysis approach  enabled us to draw from the five constructs of TAM as predefined codes, and  analyze the data. Our ultimate goal was to prove/disprove TAM related to  gaining an understanding of the faculty members&rsquo; attitudes toward the LMS. </p>
  <h2>Coding procedure  and Reliability</h2>
  <p>The coding process used to evaluate the respondents&rsquo;  comments is outlined below: <br>
    The authors prepared a code list which  included the definitions of five TAM constructs (PEOU, PU, ATT, BI, AU) and two  sample responses for each construct.  The  definitions of the TAM constructs used in the code list are presented in Table I.  A copy of this list was given to each of the coders to use as a guideline in  coding the survey scripts. According to Krippendorff (2004), units are wholes  that are distinguished and treated as independent elements. In this study,  units were defined on the basis of categorical distinctions. That is, the  comments that reference similar aspects were grouped together. If an answer  addressed more than one issue the answer content was separated. The categorization  of comments by theme was conducted separately and blindly by the authors. Each  of the authors examined 18 survey scripts, for a total of 36 responses. <br>
    The crude agreement index and  Krippendorff&rsquo;s alpha (Krippendorff, 2004, pp. 221-229) were utilized to assess  the inter-coder reliability. When the coders completed the initial stage of  coding, the crude agreement index was computed to be 69%.  At this stage, the coders were allowed to  discuss the respondents&rsquo; comments if they had any differences in their views.  It was found that, the coders were synonymously using PEOU and PU in coding the  statements. Disagreements were also found among the coders about classifying  some of the statements as ATT or BI.  After  the discussion, the coders came to an agreement, and revised their coding  accordingly, which increased the crude agreement index to76%. <br>
    As a second measure, Krippendorff&rsquo;s alpha  (Krippendorff, 2004) was employed to test the reliability of the coding  process. According to Krippendorff (2004), the alpha produces a uniform  reliability standard for a wide variety of data, it is applicable to any number  of coders, and it reflects a scientifically rigorous index of coder  agreement.  Krippendorff&rsquo;s alpha was computed  to be 0.6714, whereas for tentative conclusions the minimum alpha level that  should be reached is 0.667 (Krippendorff, 2004, p.241). Thus, the coding of the  respondents&rsquo; statements can be considered internally consistent. </p>

  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>The first objective of the study was to  gain a better understanding of the extent to which faculty members utilize  Blackboard for teaching. We investigated this by examining the types of courses  where faculty members use Blackboard. Next we identified the Blackboard  features that were used most frequently. <br>
    Most faculty members (86%) use Blackboard  to teach on-campus courses, while the others use it for online courses (17%),  for hybrid courses (17%), and a small number of faculty members do not use  Blackboard at all (11%). Related to the features of Blackboard, the ones that  are most frequently used include document uploading (86%), grade book (66%) and  assignments (tutorials, tests, quizzes) (54%). The least frequently used  features include question pools (used in texts and surveys) (14%), digital  dropbox (8.6%) and lecture hall or office hours (8.6%).  <br>
    The second objective of this study was to  identify faculty members&rsquo; attitudinal patterns toward Blackboard and the  factors that impact their attitudes. The TAM framework was used to categorize  the attitudes of the faculty members. The results are reported in accordance with  the TAM because it is the most frequently used framework to understand users&rsquo; attitudes  toward technology (Venkatesh &amp; Morris, 2000, Venkatesh &amp; Bala, 2008). We  begin this section by reporting the attitudes and perceptions from the faculty  members that use Blackboard. </p>
  <p><em>Perceived ease of use of Blackboard (PEOU). </em>The responses from the survey revealed that, faculty find Blackboard an easy and helpful tool to  facilitate their teaching activities. The main attractions of Blackboard  included: ease of use, ease of communication, ease of distributing documents,  user friendliness, confidentiality, and accessibility for document retrieval.  Faculty members also reported that the clarity and functionality of Blackboard  also influenced their perceived ease of utilization.  According to one respondent, anyone with the  basic computer and Internet skills can use it. That is, <em>&ldquo;Homework, handouts, calendar,  student presentations and papers (students&rsquo; uploads) are quicker and easier. It  allows me to do things I might not have done.&rdquo; </em></p>
  <p><em>Perceived usefulness of Blackboard (PU). </em>In many responses, survey respondents mentioned that using Blackboard saves time, and  makes their teaching activities easier. Some of the most useful features of  Blackboard reported by the respondents included: calculation of grades online,  distribution of materials (e.g., a reading assignment, quizzes), and  communication with all students simultaneously through Blackboard (e.g., chat  room, discussion board). In sum, the faculty members perceive Blackboard to be  a very useful tool. For example, one respondent stated: &ldquo;<em>It saves a lot of time spent on photocopying, using Excel to</em><em> calculate  the grade, and emailing.&rdquo; </em></p>
  <p><em>Attitude toward using Blackboard (ATT).<strong> </strong></em>From the survey responses, it seems apparent that faculty members have a positive attitude toward  Blackboard. One factor that contributed towards the positive attitude of the  faculty members was the perceived ease of the system. As  an example, one respondent stated: <em>&ldquo;If  you can operate a laptop, you can work with Blackboard&rdquo;</em>. Another example of  the perceived ease of use was illustrated by the following comment, <em>&ldquo;</em><em>I use it and it works fine.&rdquo;</em> In  conclusion both  PEOU and PU of Blackboard determined the favorable attitudes  of the faculty towards using Blackboard. </p>
  <p><em>Behavioral Intention (BI). </em>Faculty members&rsquo; behavioral intentions (BI) to use Blackboard vary  according to their perceived usefulness of Blackboard and attitudes toward  using it. That is, BI is not absolute (either you use Blackboard or not);  rather BI is measured on a continuum, where some faculty members use more or  less of the Blackboard capabilities. Faculty members who find Blackboard as a  useful tool possess a positive attitude toward it, which leads them to develop  an intention to use it in the future as well. They use most of the features on Blackboard.  In comparison, some of the faculty members  only use specific features of Blackboard, such as, uploading documents, and  grading. Typically, those faculty members have a less positive attitude about  Blackboard, and they have no intentions to utilize the full capabilities of  Blackboard. Lastly, some faculty members possess negative attitudes toward  Blackboard and do not intend to utilize Blackboard. Instead, they use their own  webpages or other online means. They have no stated intention to use Blackboard  in the future.   For example, a  respondent mentioned:  <em>&ldquo;Did not have time to explore Blackboard. I  am doing fine with other means of support.&rdquo;</em></p>
  <p><em>Actual System use (AU). </em> Drawing from the survey  responses, the respondents&rsquo; BIs largely influences their decisions to use or  not use Blackboard. As it is not mandatory for the faculty members to use  Blackboard, only those who have high intentions (BI) to use (AU) it, do so.  Some of the tech-savvy faculty members do not use it, because they find their  own web-pages or web-tools better than Blackboard.  For example, one respondent stated: <em>&ldquo;I use my own personal class web pages.&rdquo; </em>Some  of the faculty members are not willing to learn how to operate Blackboard,  because they believe Blackboard keeps changing its features and they think it  is not worth learning the changing features again and again. In a respondent&rsquo;s  view<em> &ldquo;It is difficult to keeping up with  revisions.&rdquo;</em>  However, those who use  Blackboard are positive about the changing features of Blackboard and they are  enthusiastic in learning the new features. This indicates that the extent of  Blackboard use depends on the faculty members&rsquo; level of intention to use it or  not.  <br>
    The Blackboard acceptance attitudes of the  faculty members, the influencing factors and their interrelationships are  depicted in Figure 2 using the TAM framework.</p>

    Figure 2.<em> Blackboard  Acceptance Model</em><br>
    <strong>                </strong>The non-users of Blackboard stated many of the issues as weaknesses  of Blackboard. For example, <em>poor  communication, slow response, poor interface, complex design,</em> etc. <strong> </strong>The  &ldquo;perceived weaknesses&rdquo; (i.e. <em>&ldquo;slow  response&rdquo;, &ldquo;lack of flexibility&rdquo;, &ldquo;cumbersome&rdquo;</em> etc.) and the &ldquo;perceived  difficulty of using the system&rdquo; (i.e., <em>&ldquo;exceedingly  high complexity&rdquo;,&rdquo; time consuming&rdquo;, &ldquo;frustrating&rdquo;, &ldquo;not clear or reliable&rdquo;</em>)  negatively influenced their attitudes toward Blackboard. The negative attitudes  developed toward Blackboard (<em>e.g.,  &ldquo;Blackboard is quite ridiculous&rdquo;</em>), resulted in negative behavioral  intentions (e.g., &ldquo;there are other options available online for free that I can  use…&rdquo;). The survey responses revealed that, some of the non-users are  comfortable with the traditional way of teaching and they are not willing to  switch to a new system. <br>
    From the survey responses, it was evident  that the attitude of the non-Blackboard users followed a specific pattern as  well. The non-acceptance of Blackboard by the faculty members, the influencing  factors and their interrelationships are depicted in Figure 3 using the TAM  framework.</p>

    Figure 3. <em>Blackboard  non-acceptance model  </em></p>
  <p>The third objective of the study was to  investigate the strengths and weaknesses of LMS from the respondents&rsquo; view. The  responses of the &ldquo;strengths&rdquo; and &ldquo;weaknesses&rdquo; questions included redundant  information that was provided in Question 1 (mention the three main reasons of  your using or not using Blackboard). Therefore, the redundant information was  considered and counted only once for coding.   Frequency counts were conducted to understand the relative emphasis  given to particular issues by the respondents. </p>
  <p><em>Strengths: </em>The respondents identified five different strengths  of Blackboard. The most frequently mentioned strength was the online  communication feature (39%) of Blackboard. Table II provides a frequency count  of all of the strengths mentioned by the respondents.</p>

    The fourth objective of the study was to  summarize the recommendations respondents made about how to increase the  utilization of Blackboard. There were two areas in which respondents made recommendations,  including improvements to the design of the system, and to a lesser extent,  system modifications.  <u> </u><br>
    <u> </u><br>
    <em>Design issues/recommendations: </em>Related to recommendations on how Blackboard can be  improved, the majority of the respondents (89%) identified &ldquo;design issues&rdquo; as  the area that required the most improvement. Most of these concerns were related  to the poor interface design; where many stated that the interface is cumbersome  and not user friendly. As a respondent mentioned, <em>&ldquo;.....it would be nice if the layout/interface were more flexible and  attractive.&rdquo;</em>  In addition to the  design, some respondents reported having concerns with the complexity of  Blackboard&rsquo;s features. Specific examples included poor quiz and assignment  settings, inability to email individual students from Blackboard, the grade book  function was reported as difficult to manipulate (e.g., weighting assignments  differently), and it was reported that the system ran slow when documents  (e.g., research articles) were uploaded. In summary the respondents reported a  more simplified Blackboard with clear interface and user-friendly features  would ensure increased use of Blackboard. </p>
  <p><em>System issues/recommendations:</em> Twelve respondents (67%) focused on the problems associated with  the system issues of Blackboard.  Respondents  expressed their dissatisfaction with Blackboard. Specifically, six of them  mentioned that Blackboard is not compatible with all browsers. Also, six of the  respondents complained about the incompatibility of Blackboard with other  software.  Frequent system disruptions and  slow response time were two other issues they mentioned.  In summary, the respondents recommended that   Blackboard should be upgraded or modified to  ensure compatibility with various Internet browsers and software. </p>
  <p><em>Training and awareness  issues/recommendations:  </em>Six (33%) out of a total 18 respondents mentioned their concerns  about lack of appropriate training, and awareness of Blackboard. In a  respondent&rsquo;s words, <em>&ldquo;train faculty  members and explain them the green side of it.&rdquo;</em> Faculty suggested  organizing department wide regular training and workshop sessions to build  Blackboard awareness among the faculty members.  <br>
    Table IV provides a frequency count of all  of the major recommendations made by the respondents. In sum, three sound  recommendations were made from the survey respondents including: improve the  functionality and design of Blackboard (e.g., provide email options), ensure  Blackboard is compatible with various (Internet) browsers and software  packages, and provide training and increase awareness of Blackboard among faculty  members, and others with teaching responsibility (e.g., Graduate Teaching  Assistants). </p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>The TAM framework provided a generalizable  approach leveraged to evaluate the faculty&rsquo;s attitude toward the LMS;  specifically Blackboard. The study revealed that, collectively, the attitudes  of Blackboard users&rsquo; and non-users&rsquo; follow specific patterns. That is, those  who use Blackboard, and those who do not, held varied beliefs about its use,  effectiveness, and limitations.  <br>
    Our analysis suggests that utilizing the  TAM framework provides a practical way of organizing the open-ended  information. In addition, the TAM framework is not unique to any specific  field/organization. Therefore, the research framework presented here offers a  generalizable approach to assess the users&rsquo; attitude toward any kind of  technology. In sum, we believe that the TAM framework holds promise for both  scholars and technology developers. In particular, when used to guide the  understanding of users&rsquo; attitudes toward technology, the framework can help  identify key attitudes that shape behavioral intentions as well as the actual  usage of the technology in question.  <br>
    The findings of the study help us  understand the problems associated with the specific features of Blackboard and  what needs to be done to address the negative beliefs of the users and to  ensure increased use of Blackboard. Based on the findings, the following  conclusions were drawn:<br>
    In  analyzing the responses, it was apparent that many of the faculty members had  difficulty working with Blackboard. This indicates that Blackboard should be  redesigned to better accommodate the end-users. As an example, Blackboard  should be upgraded to make it compatible with other software and with all  browsers.  The respondents also mentioned  that Blackboard is slow, and in many instances it frequently shuts down. This  suggests the technical and system issues are other areas that need careful  attention.<br>
    Secondly, there is an opportunity for more  training to occur on Blackboard, especially for the end-users that are either  not familiar or comfortable with Blackboard, or those that use only select  features of Blackboard (i.e., posting grades).   It appears the workshops and training programs that the university  offers currently are not adequate to support all faculty members&rsquo; needs and  expectations.  Offering extensive  awareness programs, workshops and training sessions would help the faculty  members to become familiar with and skilled in using Blackboard.  In addition, prior to offering Blackboard  training programs, it would be helpful to conduct a needs analysis to better  understand the individual training needs of the end-users. <br>
    The study found that, the majority of the  respondents (85%) use Blackboard for grading only. This indicates that the  faculty members are either not well aware of, or not interested in using the  other features of Blackboard. Even if they are aware of these features, they do  not know how to use them; nor, do they understand how these features could  benefit or ease their teaching activities. <br>
    In general, given that universities are  making considerable financial investments when the LMS is purchased, it is in  the university&rsquo;s best interest to ensure that the system is widely utilized  across faculty. In addition, periodic evaluation of the LMS performance should  be done, so that the decision-makers know in which areas faculty members are  facing problems in working with the LMS, how to improve them to ensure more  acceptance of, and higher satisfaction with the performance of the LMS. <br>
    The study has some limitations. The  present research collected data only through an electronic survey and it is  based on a single LMS, Blackboard.   In  addition, the surveys alone provide limited information and the findings  therefore may not include all perspectives (Hammond &amp; Wiriyapinit, 2005,  Gilead, 2006). To cross-validate the data, future studies may employ more than  one approach of data collection (i.e interview, focus group study etc.). Conducting  a quantitative study to confirm the casual relationships among the constructs  of the LMS acceptance model would also be a future research direction.  Follow-up studies can be conducted to understand how the incorporation of a  LMS, increases the instructor&rsquo;s effectiveness, in a given course. A comparative  study of more than one LMS would also be an important area for future  investigation. Moreover, discipline wide study could be conducted in the future  to determine the LMS use across multiple disciplines.</p>
