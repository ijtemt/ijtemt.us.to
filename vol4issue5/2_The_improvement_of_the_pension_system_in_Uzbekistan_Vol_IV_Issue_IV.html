  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><strong> </strong><br>
    Government&rsquo;s policy in financing social sphere is becoming  more and more topical. In this regard, managing pension system effectively,  conducting research basing on &ldquo;income distribution through the time&rdquo; principle  in its financing is of particular significance. In this article the possibility  of applying the experience of European Union countries in the level of coverage  of population by the pension plan and its development in Uzbekistan. </p>
  <p><strong>Key words:</strong> Pension  System, Social Insurance</p>
  <h1>&nbsp;<strong>Introduction</strong></h1>
  <p>Pension system was established as a branch of the institute of  social protection within modern economy. The average life expectancy of people,  a significant increase in the number of people compared to the ones who are  capable of working, and, a constant development of the social criteria of  living arise the necessity of progress in all institutions of social  protection, particularly pension system. <br>
    Nowadays, in Uzbekistan 11 percent of the population is  covered by the pension system, which means that the influence on the pension  system is not significant. The same indicator is represented 27 percent in  Russia and 25 percent in Europe (Islamov B., Shadiev R). Currently, it is  important to study experience of the developed countries and to assess the  opportunities of application of it in Uzbekistan analyzing the existing  situation in the area in order to reform the pension system.<br>
    The countries of European Union are experiencing certain  difficulties in the pension system. In general the pension system formed on the  basis of employers insurance premiums and voluntary insurance premiums in  addition to state retirement allowance works in European Union countries.  Although voluntary pension insurance is promoted through a variety of tax  incentives or similar encouragements, public pension expenditure growth trends  are observed. In European Union countries, the share of public pension  expenditure to GDP is expected to grow from 9.5 percent in 2015 to 11.7 percent  in 2050. This situation can be explained by two factors: decrease in the birth  rate and increase in average life expectancy. Provision of pensions of  pensioners is covered by the various reforms carried out in the countries of  the EU. In this regard, measures to increase the retirement age and pension  contributions can represent an example of that.<br>
    Today, more than 2 million 873 thousand people are over 60  years old in our country. During the years of independence our people, average  age grew from 67 years in 1990 to 73.5 years, to 75.8 years among women, while  the birth rate decreased from 34.5% to 23.2% in 2010.<br>
    At the same time, the development of the &quot;income  distribution through the time&quot; principle is of great significance. For  this reason, the issues dealing with financial regulation of the development of  social protection of the citizens being retired are topical.<br>
    Therefore, this research is aimed at revealing and evaluating  such indicators as the level of coverage of population by the pension system in  Uzbekistan and its task of social protection.</p>
  <h1><strong>Literature</strong><strong> Review</strong></h1>
  <p>The reformation of the state pension provision system is  becoming one of the pressing issues Holzmann&rsquo;s (1997) reforms the state pension  system is essential in many countries. He stated that leaving the state pension  ignored by the state will generate a secret financial debt in the future.<br>
    According to Poteraj (2008), reforming the pension system is  carried out in the European countries by means of growing pension contributions  or increasing retirement age. However, pension contributions increase labor  costs, and will have a negative impact on the competitiveness of economy.  Therefore, this figure cannot be increased significantly. Raising the age of  retirement is also widespread among the EU countries, which is to be  restricted, according to him.<br>
    According to Grech (2010), reforming most of pension systems  is carried out in rather limited sustainability, by means of reducing the  principle of the government&rsquo;s expenditure dealing with social protection. But,  if the system cannot cover pension expenses because of enlarging number of  pensioners, it leads to increasing the risk.&nbsp;  Hence, the government has to increase social expenses by means of  converse reforms.<br>
    Ionescu&rsquo;s study (2013)&nbsp;  reveals that , if in Europe the share of the people who are older than  65 years reaches 25 percent, in subsequent 20-30 years dependency rate will  exceed 40 percent.&nbsp; In the most of  countries the replacement rate maintains very high, about 60-70 percent. In  order to fix the mentioned problems dealing with the development of the pension  system in the country, this scientist draws attention to: developing private  pension provision; mixed managing system of government and private system;  decreasing payment of social protection systemically.<br>
    Legros (2013) thinks that such indicators as the increase in  the number of those who are able to work, the growth in the labor phase and  retirement are of great significance in reforming the system of pension  provision, otherwise the government can decrease the replacement rate.<br>
    Patten Priestley Mahler, Matthew M. Chingos, and Grover  J.Whitehurst (2014) think developed pension system should provide three main  goals. They are: providing employees with pension security, providing stability  of fiscal policy, providing increasing (ensuring) productivity of labor force.  They state, collective defined-contribution plan should be implemented covering  optimal aspects of defined-benefit and defined-contribution pension systems to  attain the afore stated goal.&nbsp; <br>
    According to Vakhobov (2003), pension fund is leading one  among the social funds of the state. The market relations pave the way for the  necessity to reform the pension systems in order to stimulate economic  activeness of people. He also noted the significance of the development of the  saving pension fund and the development of the Fund's investment activities.</p>

    Firstly,  to ensure minimum life standards and financial support of  population who is unable to work. To eliminate the effects of poverty,  to maintain social equality irrespective of the capability of working.<br>
    Secondly,  to take into account the share of personal labor of pensioners in implementing retirement supply in accordance  with the incomes of the population. <br>
    Thirdly,  pension supply through the personal initiative.<br>
    Therefore,  the pension system is one of the most important elements of social protection.  This system performs important functions in the economy, they are:<br>
    Firstly,  it protects from the poverty during old age.<br>
    Secondly,  provides with a guaranteed income on retiring, and the value depends on one&rsquo;s  wages. <br>
    Third,  the income does not allow reducing the living standards as a result of  inflation in the future.<br>
    In  general, the world pension`s supply system is theoretically divided into two  major groups (Volkov Ya, 2009):<br>
    1.  Defined Benefit (DB);<br>
    2.  Defined Contribution (DC).<br>
    In  the Defined benefit the participants of pension supply are guaranteed with a  certain amount of pensions and allowances.<br>
    In the Defined contribution the amount of  pension payments depend on the amount of contributions paid earlier.</p>
  <p><strong>3.2. Pension System (</strong><strong>Provision)</strong><strong> in European Union </strong><strong>C</strong><strong>ountries</strong></p>
  <p>In European countries the following  principles form the pension provision system:<br>
    the scale of population  coverage by the pension provision system;<br>
    the existing requirements in  pension payments;<br>
    The sources of financing.<br>
    It should be noted, in European countries  pension provision systems have also been formed in forms of insurance (DC) or  universal (DB). Obviously, pension provision based on the insurance system is  practically the same with the defined contribution system.<br>
    &nbsp;The studies reveal that the pension provision  system established in European countries can be divided into 2 huge models (see  Table 1):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>universal (national) system of pension provision;</li>
    <li>Insurance pension system formed on the basis of insurance relations.</li>

  <p>It should be noted, in European countries  insurance payments account for 60% of the social sphere budget (Ijaeva, 2013,  p.31).<br>
    It means the formation level of the social insurance relations  the realization of the pension provision. The reason is that insurance  relations lead in organizing social activities in the continent. In addition,  pension provision is one of the major aspects of the social sector and there  are various opinions about the stages of its development.<br>
    In European countries the insurance pension  provision system is formed in according with the following principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>insurance of economically active population;</li>
    <li>funding pension payments due to insurance premiums of workers and  insured people;</li>
    <li>The relevance pension payments to the previous income and insurance  experience of the insurer.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;This  mechanism was widely used in European countries such as Germany, France, Italy,  Spain and Greece.<br>
    Although in these countries pension  provision system operates on the basis of a unique concept, there are some other  different aspects. In particular, there are financing, organizational structure  and functional responsibilities among them. Therefore, the insurance pension  model can be observed in a mixture form in EU countries. For example, the  distribution (mandatory insurance pension), supplementary pension programs  (France and Spain) and directing insurance payments to capital investments (the  Netherlands) are done in forms of pension provision system.<br>
    In fact they have appeared and developed in a different way, but in practice they can be used in mixed form. As a result of the reforms carried out in the  system, in European  Union countries the  integration of the two models can be witnessed. For instance, in a number of  countries a universal pension system came into existence, fundamental economic  changes contributed to the establishment of the pension insurance provision.  The additional pension system in a mandatory form (Great Britain) could be a  clear example of this fact.<br>
    We  believe that basing on the functions of the pension system such processes as  distribution of the economic value created in the country (established payment  system) and saving (established payment system) emerge. Therefore, these  elements should be taken into account in the development of the pension system.</p>
  <p><strong>3.3. Occurrence</strong><strong> of Pension Provision (Schemes) </strong><strong>in Uzbekistan and Its Theoretical Foundations</strong></p>
  <p>In  Uzbekistan the pension system is being formed on the basis of established  payment system (Defined Benefit - DB).<br>
    The Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan &ldquo;On citizens&rsquo; state  pension provision&rdquo; adopted in 1993 is of crucial importance. This law  constitutes the legal basis of the currently operating pension system.  According to the law, the pensions are divided into 3 types. They are as  follows:<br>
    Pensions related to age. Men &ndash;  60 years, women &ndash; 55 years;<br>
    Disability pensions;<br>
    Pensions related to the loss  of the breadwinner.<br>
    The Pension Fund outward the state  budget shares the costs in the following order for the above-mentioned types of pensions:<br>
    To pay state pensions to working pensioners;<br>
    To pay state pensions to unemployed pensioners;<br>
    Pensions for the elderly without  the right to the state pensions and disabled people. <br>
    The pensionss for the burial ceremony. <br>
    Revenues of the the off-budget Pension Fund are formed in the following order in order to cover its expenses: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>fixed revenue from the Single social payment (25% of the wages fund is  paid by legal entities (15% for small firms since 2015);</li>
    <li>citizens' insurance payments to the off-budget Pension Fund (7% of  individuals&rsquo; salaries are paid);</li>
    <li>mandatory payments to the off-budget Pension Fund (1.6% of the sales  revenue of goods is paid).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the pension system for self-employed people there are  different rates of mandatory insurance payments. Article 311 of the Tax Code  clearly defines these circumstances. We can see them below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Individual entrepreneurs have to pay compulsory  insurance payments on  the  amount not less than the minimum wage per month.</li>
    <li>Members of the peasant farm in case they are established  by a legal  entity or not  have to pay established voluntary insurance payments on the amount of not less than four  and a half times of  the  minimum wage. While  calculating the amount of insurance contributions the work experience of the  farm member is considered as a year. </li>
    <li>Family members carrying out  activities in the form of a family business without forming legal entity have to pay the following  amounts of insurance:</li>
    <li>a member of the family registered as an individual entrepreneur&nbsp; - the amount not less than the minimum wage  per month;</li>
    <li>Other members of the family (with the exception of people under the age  of eighteen) - 50 per cent of the minimum wage per month.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Analysis of the Current State of Pension Provision</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>4.1. Financial State  of Pension Provision in European Countries and Ways of Its Implementation in  Uzbekistan </strong><strong> </strong></p>
  <p>One of the main aspects of pension provision is the scale of population coverage.  Therefore, universal pension system provides a permanent resident population in  the country, moreover, in some countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands it  covers not only their own citizens, but also citizens of other countries  residing permanently in the country.<br>
    For example, nowadays in Great Britain the  level of population coverage by pension provision is as follows [Danishevskaya,  2010]:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>state mandatory pension provision &ndash; 65 percent;</li>
    <li>additional pension provision system (insurance pension provided by  businesses) - 25 percent;</li>
    <li>Personal insurance pension - 10 percent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>According to the studies conducted, it could  be noted that pension provision can be divided into three parts in terms of  scale of the population coverage: firstly, the pension insurance is only for  those who operate on a contractual basis (Denmark and Sweden). Secondly, except  working on a contract basis, it includes people with private activities in  addition to contractual ones (Austria, Italy and the Netherlands). Thirdly, it  is the system which represents pension provision for all employed population  (France, Great Britain and Sweden).<br>
    In  more than 15 countries of European Union, 25 percent of population works in  temporary jobs, while 20 percent works in part-time job[International social  security association, 2010]. In turn it leads to a significant decrease in the  funds coming social insurance funds. <br>
    As a  result, the growing tendency of the share of public expenditure in the pension  provision system is observed. For instance, in such countries as Sweden and  Italy the system of conditional pension account has been established, a sharp  increase in public expenditure is not observed. In this regard, it can be seen  how important the establishment of the existing pension provision institution  is (Table 2).</p>

  <p>Based  on different pieces of research, it must be noted that, significant economic  and demographic changes have an influence on the scale of pension plan. Thus,  decision on the retirement age is considered is important. It is permitted in  some European Union countries to carry on working after reaching retirement  age. In turn, it contributes to increase in pension of those who work after  retirement. On the other hand, in some cases, it leads to increase ratio  between those who are capable of working and the retired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
    It  must be also emphasized that, in modern economic conditions, decrease in rate  of birth and increase in life expectancy causes certain difficulties within  pension system. In particular those who are over 65 represent 16% of population  (it was estimated to 18.2% in 2013 [source: Eurostat regional yearbook  2014.p.30], the studies conducted by the UNO the same indicator reaches 25% in  2030, 28% in 2050. Nowadays in Europe, one can find 4 employees for every  person who is over 65, this indicator will amount to 2.4 in Great Britain, 2.3  in France, 2 and 1.5 in Germany and Italy respectively causing difficult  situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Between  1960-2000, life expectance in European Union increased by 4 years, while the  same indicator is expected to reach 8.5 years among men and 6.9 among women.  Besides that, birth rate for every woman is even lower than the criterion of  2.1. For example, the highest level of this indicator is 2.0 in France. The  average level of it in EU is 1.4. The same figure amounts to 2.5 in Uzbekistan  (source: Social Policy Highlight)<br>
    In  EU countries, similar occurrences in social sphere cause financial  difficulties. This, in turn, increases the volume of public expenditure on  pension system (see table 2). In particular, the growth in the proportion of the  retired in the total number of population leads to instability within the  system, the need of the elderly for medical service is expected to double. This  requires complex financial reforms to develop social life. <br>
    In  our opinion the retirement age being fixed is one of the major indicators in  holding reforms in pension plan. In this regard it is necessary to apply new  methods or to introduce additional social protection mechanisms in the given  direction of social protection. <br>
    The  tendencies of solving certain problems by means of increasing the retirement  age within the pension plan. For instance the pension reforms approved by the  Lower Chamber of France indicate that the retirement age will grow 60 to 62 in  2018. The age to be provided with complete pension is expected to increase from  65 to 67 [Muravleva, 2011]. <br>
    Studies reveal that the average retirement  age 63. The public expenditure in this direction is expected to grow in the  coming years. This is in turn; it directly connected with the growth in the  proportion of the retired people compared to the total number of employees. </p>

  <p>In  Uzbekistan the proportion of those who receive pension from the public  retirement fund in the total number of population fell in 2014 compared to the  same indicator in 2010. It is explained with the fact that the number of people  receiving pension for disability and the loss of breadwinner decreased. However  it can be observed that the number of the people receiving on reaching the age  remains constant. It can be explained with the fact that the retirement age  hasn&rsquo;t changed and the average life expectancy is not increasing sharply in  Uzbekistan.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    In  this regard it must be noted that the coverage by the pension plan will  completely different in 2050. That is because the number of retired people is  expected to grow by that time.<br>
    In  addition to that, between 2006 and 2010, the proportion of those who are under  the age of being capable of working decreased to 2.6 percent or 235.4 thousand  people. As a result of that, proportion of able bodied population decreased by  3.5 percent. This is in turn one of the factors adversely influencing the  coverage level of the pension plan. <br>
    We  believe that it is necessary to increase the retirement age gradually in the  future, taking into consideration the increase in the proportion of the retired  people in the total number population in Uzbekistan in 2013-2050 (see  figure1).&nbsp; <br>
    The fact that in 2014 the retired people  were paid over 11 trillion 618 milliard Uzbek soums of pension, over 105  milliard Uzbek soums of allowances in Uzbekistan is clear cut example of that.  It represents 8% of the GDP. If this indicator amounts to 8 now, one can say  that this expenditure will increase according to figure1.&nbsp; <br>
    We think that the significant part of the population is  represented by the retired people in developed countries as well. That&rsquo;s why  the efforts dealing with optimization of the expenditure on the pension plan in  the countries of European Union. <br>
    We  believe that considering the experience of Germany is of crucial importance. If  the ratio of the 65 year-olds and even older people to able-bodied was 16/100  in 1950, this indicator is expected to reach 67/100 in 2050. In turn the  development of this complicated situation can lead to economic  instability[Marek G&oacute;ra 2014].&nbsp; <br>
    It  must be emphasized that due to getting retired before reaching the age of 65,  the pension will be reduced by 0.3 percent for every month for the period  before reaching the age. If one is retired at the age of 60, the amount of  pension will be reduced by 18% (0.3 multiplied by 60 months) and when one is 65  years old the reduction will be removed. This rule is also applied to  government employees as well. (see table 4)</p>

  <p>Although  there are opportunities to receive pension payments before reaching the  established age, the payment of a complete pension is only provided on reaching  the retirement age.<br>
    It  is essential to mention that, in case of retiring on reaching the established  age (65), pension payment is increased by 0.5 % per month for each month of  work.<br>
    On  such occasion, the growth in the proportion of the people of the retirement age  in the total number of population in our country by 2050 makes it essential to  modify the direction of expenditure and classify incomes (see figure 1.)<br>
    Therefore,  we think that the following items should be taken into consideration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To set in classified percentage a share of sum, discounted for each  month until achievement of the required retirement age in establishing pension  in accordance with age (For cases, provided in article 14 of the Law of the  Republic of Uzbekistan &ldquo;On state pension plan of citizens&rdquo;).</li>
    <li>to set raise amount of pensioner&rsquo;s pension in percentages in relation to  extra worked months, but not in relation to the amount of average salary (in  accordance with article 27 of the same Law).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It  contributes to using funds of pension system in an effective manner. We  consider that these measures provide the reasonability of expenses, on the  other hand, further development of social protection of population, especially  senor generation.<br>
    There  is a separate pension systems for self-employed people in the countries of the  European Union. But in our country, there are private entrepreneurs, farmers,  and those who run their family business among the payers of obligatory payments  into the public pension fund. The people of those categories are also provided  with pension in accordance with general rules. <br>
    European  experience shows the pension system of the self-employed people operates  separately. One of the advantages of this, It excludes the situation when those  who paid different amounts of insurance payments are provided with the same  amount of pension. The reforms carried our country reflect studying this  experience and applying it. <br>
    It  must be particularly underlined that the tendencies of transition from the  system of Defined Benefit to the system of the Defined Contribution in the  countries of European Union. It is necessary to hold similar reforms in our  country as well.[Werner Eichhorst (IZA), Connie Nielsen (NIRAS), Maarten Gerard  (IDEA Consult). 2011]<br>
    The  adoption of the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of  Uzbekistan No. 90 dd. on April 14, 2015 &ldquo;On the measures to introduce the  individual accounting the data dealing with the citizens&rsquo; insurance payments to  the off-budget pension fund under the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of  Uzbekistan&rdquo; contributes to the further implementation of the reforms in the  area.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    In  accordance with it the obligatory insurance payments of the payers to the  pension fund are reflected in their personal accounts. That&rsquo;s why it is  necessary to re-develop payments in terms of the payers of pension  contributions. <br>
    Therefore,  it is important to review orders for calculation of pension payments for  self-employed people. </p>
  <p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
  <p>In  our opinion, at the moment of retirement of the people, amount of appointed  pension does not depend on his/her work experience, but on insurance  experience. The principle of &ldquo;the unity of generations&rdquo; disappears, and the  principle &ldquo;income distribution through the time&rdquo; emerges and develops. Hence,  as the insurance experience hasn&rsquo;t been paid enough attention, the pension fund  has experienced certain financial complexities.<br>
    We  may notice an evidence of this opinion in the following words mentioned by  D.Vakhobov (2012, p12.): &ldquo;Availability of many preferences in the pension  system, payment of premiums paid in addition to pension, calculation of pension  amount not on insurance experience, but on work experience cause deficiency in  pension fund&rdquo;.<br>
    We believe that certain problems occur  dealing with the coverage of the retired people by the pension plan of the  country. The following aspects can be referred to them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>high death indicators of population capable of  working </li>
    <li>large share of the population incapable of  working </li>
    <li>significant level of preferences (especially in  regard with age) dealing with the public mandatory pension plan.</li>
    <li>problems dealing with the permanent employment  of the population capable of working.</li>
    <li>significant increase in unofficial salaries in  economy. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We  think that it is essential to take measures extendedly in order to increase the  scope of the coverage by the pension plan. Particularly, if increase in the  indicators of people&rsquo;s health and forming healthy life style are related to the  growth in budget funds, then consequently the increase in the life expectancy  by a year contributes the growth in the number of people of the retirement age.  This, in turn, arises the necessity to meet the needs of the retired people for  finances and medical services.&nbsp; </p>
  <p><strong>6.  Conclusion </strong></p>
  <p>We  think that it is necessary to pay attention to the following factors in holding  reforms in pension plan:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Indicators of the coverage of  the pension plan </li>
    <li>adaptability of payments of  pension plan (taking into consideration inflation rate and purchasing power)</li>
    <li>Conducting  payment of contributions to pension fund in accordance with the share of payers</li>
    <li>Diversification  of gaining incomes in the system of pension plan (public and private insurance)</li>
    <li>To  introduce special pension system for self-employed people </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Moreover we believe that it is  necessary to evaluate the opportunities dealing with the coverage of the  pension system and to pay particular attention to the indicators increasing the  attractiveness of it. In turn, it is explained with the assessment criteria of  the system creating the conditions for the development of the activity in the  area. <br>
    They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Taking into consideration of international standards of minimum criterion&nbsp; of social protection; </li>
    <li>Solving the problems which are relevant to the progress&nbsp; of the mandatory social insurance;</li>
    <li>the completeness and stability&nbsp; of  the legal base of the mandatory social insurance;</li>
    <li>scientific validity of insurance tariffs;</li>
    <li>developing the mechanism of collecting insurance contributions;</li>
    <li>continual payment of insurance payments by insurers;</li>
    <li>existence of an opportunity to check the amount of the pension by the  person who benefits from that;</li>
    <li>Using efficiency of the mandatory social insurance reserves</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In conclusion, for improving the country&rsquo;s  social security institute it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to financial reforms.  In this regard, the pension system is considered to an important link in the  area. Therefore, for the development of the pension system it&rsquo;s important to  take into consideration the ideas and views which are mentioned. </p>
