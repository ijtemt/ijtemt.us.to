Paper Title :<br>STATE OF NATURAL GAS SECTOR IN INDIA <br>
POLICY INTERVENTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT GAS MARKET</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Energy availability and accessibility, is key for growth and development of any country. India does not produce sufficient energy to meet its demand. Moreover, a large part of India does not have the basic infrastructure to transport energy. India, the fourth largest energy consumer in the world plans to meet part of its energy requirement by increasing the share of gas in the energy mix to 20% (current 7.1%) by 2030. This would require reforms, in the gas sector, to correct the inherent structural and policy issues, thereby enabling the required flow of capital. India started with sincerity on the reform path post 1991 in all sectors including energy, but market distortions continue, including lack of transparency, market monopoly and monopsony powers. Literature review is carried out to study the evolution of gas markets in various countries. Study of US and UK markets provide important learnings for India to move to a fully developed efficient market stage. As a minimum India needs to focus on development of infrastructure, deregulate gas price at the wellhead, break monopoly power, gradually reducing monopsony and introducing transparency.

    <li>Introduction</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The growth in primary energy consumption  of India, for the year 2014 over 2013  is 7.1%. This is considerably higher compared to the world average, growth rate  of 0.9%. (BP, 2015). Availability of natural  gas, as an energy source is vital to meet this growing  energy need for India. However, the measures undertaken by the Government of  India to meet the growing energy demand in the past few years, have not  resulted in any substantial increase in energy availability, to its 1.2 billion  people (Census 2011). One of the potential means to resolve India&rsquo;s growing  energy needs is to provide an enabling environment for the energy sector, in  order to attract investment, and increase availability and accessibility of  energy. This paper, attempts to establish the policy interventions required for  development of an efficient gas market in India, to help increase energy  availability and accessibility. The paper also provides recommendation on gaps,  in the existing policy and regulations, for development of such market. In the second  section the paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the current status  of gas markets in India, followed with </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>establishing the need for development of an efficient gas  market in the third section. The fourth section evaluates international gas markets  of the US and the UK, capturing key learning&rsquo;s and bringing out the structural  and policy gaps in the Indian gas market. The conclusion and the recommendation  on the policy enablers and the interventions required, for the gas sector in  India are provided in the last section.<strong> </strong></p>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>The  primary energy consumption of the world in the year 2014 was 12,928 Million  tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). Asia Pacific consumed 5334Mtoe of energy, of  which India&rsquo;s contribution was 638Mtoe. Top five nations (China, US, Russia,  India and Japan), consumed 54% of the total primary energy consumed in the  world. India retained its position as the fourth largest primary energy  consumer in the world (after China, US and Russia)  accounting for 4.9% of the world consumption. Oil &amp; gas in India constitute  35.4% (28.3% oil &amp; 7.1% gas) of the India&rsquo;s primary energy consumption (BP, 2015) (Figure 1). The energy demand in  India is expected to grow at 6% with the targeted GDP growth rate of 9%. The  share of gas in the primary energy mix is projected to grow, to at least 20% by  the year 2030 ([MoPNG(GoI)], 2013).The  current world average of gas in the primary energy  mix stood at 23.6%. </p>

    India  has 0.8% of the proven gas reserves of the world. The current production of gas  in India is just 0.9% of the total world production at around 39.7 Billion  cubic meters (Bcm) while it consumes around 50.6  Bcm of gas, which is circa 1.5 % of the total world consumption. The  average production of gas has declined 5.9% in the  last one year. This is due to the continued drop in the production from the  KGD6 field (east coast of India) and no new production coming on-stream. India (5.7%) is the fourth largest importer of  LNG after Japan (36.2%), South Korea (15.3%) and China (8.1%). Asia remained  the key market for LNG trade consuming circa 73% of the world LNG supply while  Qatar retained its position as the largest supplier contributing 31% of the  world LNG (BP, 2015). </p>
  <p>India  consumes more energy than it produces. The oil import bill for the year 2012-13  was $143.8 bn. (GoI, 2013). India is the third  largest oil importer after US and China. While India has an estimated  sedimentary area of 3.14 million Sqkm, comprising of 26 sedimentary basins, an  area of 1.5 million sqkm has so far been awarded under the NELP, which works  out to almost 48% of the total sedimentary area in the country. (GoI, 2014). However a large part of the above  sedimentary area is already relinquished by the operators (106 blocks out of  254 awarded so far) due to a number of reasons. Further, production has started  in just 3 blocks and major gas discoveries have been mired with litigations and  controversies. Focus, on domestic production would, not only help ease the  burden of high import bill but also ensure energy availability and security for  the 1.2 billion population, the biggest challenge in front of the nation. India  has a low per capita consumption of energy of 0.5toe as against the world  average of 1.8toe. The 13th plan document of government of India envisages  more than doubling of the per capita energy consumption in India to 1.2toe by  2030. Also it envisages an investment potential of more than $45bn in the  midstream and downstream segments of the gas chain to meet the increasing  demand. </p>
  <p>Natural  gas therefore, is positioned to play a bigger role in the Indian energy mix  (20% target by 2030) and would be a factor in the economic growth of the  country. To achieve this, government of India needs to attract higher  investment in the gas sector. But there are inherent structural, institutional  and policy issues in the oil &amp; gas sector in India which needs to be  addressed if India has to come close to meeting the above objectives. </p>

      <li><em>History &amp;  Structure of the Indian Gas market</em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  current state of gas market in India can be best described as controlled,  largely by government, with oligopolistic characteristics (few large players  control the market) with interventions from the government across the gas  chain. There are only few producers even after opening up the sector for  international competitive bidding (under the new exploration and licensing  policy- NELP) in 1997-98. Transmission infrastructure is underdeveloped and  major players act as integrated suppliers, shippers/ marketers of gas. The  domestic gas is allocated by the Government of India (&ldquo;GoI&rdquo;) as per the gas  utilization policy whereas the price of gas is determined for each source of  supply following the principles set in production sharing contracts. GAIL India  Limited is the sole buyer of all domestic gas and acts on the directives from  the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (&ldquo;MoPNG&rdquo;). The demand of gas from the  customers is enormous, primarily from segments like Power, Fertilizer,  Industries and city gas distribution. &nbsp;Among  these power and fertilizer are very sensitive to the price of gas, which they  can afford because of the distortions which continue in the downstream markets  (Price controls on fertilizer and Electricity). The Indian oil &amp; gas history  can be divided into three distinct era&rsquo;s which is depicted in Figure 2.<br>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>The  Indian oil and gas sector can be divided into the upstream, midstream  (transportation) and the downstream (supply &amp; distribution) sector. The upstream  sector is controlled by the policies formulated by the MoPNG at the federal  level. MoPNG is assisted in its efforts to formulate policies and grant  concessions and monitor the exploration and production by Director General of  Hydrocarbons (&ldquo;DGH&rdquo;). The planning and safety issues are dealt by petroleum,  planning and analysis cell (&ldquo;PPAC&rdquo;) and safety issues by Oil and safety  directorate (&ldquo;OISD&rdquo;). All the upstream agencies work under the direction of the  MoPNG and hence the government is still the regulator for the upstream sector,  and in a position to take decisions which often are driven by political  compulsions. The GoI, in the year 2006 enacted through an Act of parliament the  Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory bill, to establish an independent  regulator, the Petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (&ldquo;PNGRB&rdquo;) to regulate  the midstream and the downstream sectors of oil &amp; gas industry. The PNGRB  has since the year 2007 formulated various rule and regulation. </p>

    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>The  government and the regulator have attempted to liberalize the sector through  measures like international competitive bidding and open access norms. The construct  of PNGRB Act, 2006 require the regulations to be light handed with end prices  to consumer unregulated, while competition is brought in through limited  marketing exclusivity. But the midstream sector remain underdeveloped with  monopoly right granted to the LNG regas terminal operators, which coupled with  allocation of natural gas from domestic sources is hindering any market  mechanism to evolve. </p>
  <p>The  key attributes of the natural gas market in India as it exists currently is summarized  as</p>
  <ul>
    <li>International  competitive bidding for upstream acreages but price controls at wellhead.  Discussion to move from a production sharing to revenue sharing structure. </li>
    <li>Domestic gas  allocation and pricing determined by GoI although current PSC provide freedom  to determine gas price on competitive arm&rsquo;s length basis, but approved by GoI</li>
    <li>LNG import allowed  under open general license (OGL). No terminal currently operating on tolling  basis; limiting access to market participants.</li>
    <li>Plan to import gas  from resource rich countries like Turkmenistan, Iran and Russia, through cross  country pipelines but geopolitical constraints would delay such projects.</li>
    <li>Transmission  pipeline under development by few large players with major slippages in  timeline; large population still not covered through pipeline; open access norm  in place</li>
    <li>Bundled entities  allowed to transport and market gas with accounting separation principle;  discussion on timeline for unbundling in progress</li>
    <li>Distribution and  marketing segment not developing due to high LNG prices (although considerably softened  since Q1 2015) coupled with distortions in Power, Fertilizer and transport fuel  markets</li>
    <li>Challenges in  power sector reforms, since under domain of state, and hence not integrated to  the central policy.</li>

  <p><img width="322" height="211" src="1_State_of_Natural_Gas_Sector_in_India_Vol_IV_Issue_IV_image006.png" align="left">The natural gas demand (unconstrained) in India is set  to grow significantly at a CAGR of 6.8% from 242.6 MMSCMD in 2012-13 to 746  MMSCMD in 2029-30. The total supply of natural gas is expected to grow at a  CAGR of 7.2% from 2012 to 2030 reaching 400 MMSCMD by 2021-22 and 474 MMSCMD by  2029-30 (PNGRB, Industry Group, 2013).  The above demand assumes price inelasticity and hence unconstraint in nature.  The total unconstrained demand includes 65-70% consumption from two key segments,  of power and fertilizer which are price sensitive; hence the demand may witness  substantial reduction at higher prices. However, the real test would be the  sustainability of gas demand, after power and fertilizer sector are allowed to function  on market principles. Therefore, while the demand supply gap widens, based on  projections, it needs to be tested how much of the demand is fuelled by the  distortion of market based on policy measures meant to appease the masses. The  demand supply balance is depicted in Figure 3.</p>
  <p>The  design capacity of existing pipeline in India currently stands at 337 mmscmd  with a length of circa 15,000 kms. The pipeline capacity and length is set to  expand exponentially and would reach 815 mmscmd with a length of 32, 000 kms with  the planned addition during the 12th and the 13th five year plan. Currently  four regas terminals are operational on the west coast of India (Petronet,  Shell, Dhabol and Kochi) with an aggregate capacity of circa 17.3mtpa  (63.7mmscmd). With additions of all planned terminals the capacity would  increase to 83mtpa (305 mmscmd) in the next 10 years i.e by 2023 (PNGRB, Industry Group, 2013). The existing  and proposed infrastructure is depicted in Figure 4.</p>

  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Pricing of natural  gas in India</em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The  price of gas in India varies based on the source of production. Primarily there  are two price regimes in India; 1) Administered price mechanism (&ldquo;APM&rdquo;) wherein  government fixes price of gas on a cost plus basis for the nominated fileds; 2)  Non APM or free market price gas. Non APM gas price can be further subdivided  into a) Pre-NELP discovered fields (PMT/Ravva/ Niko/Cairn) and b) NELP fields.  Non APM price is based on the production sharing contracts signed between  government and producers. Recently the GoI, under the marginal field policy,  has declared that few select discovered fields, to be auctioned in next NELP  round, would be allowed to sell gas at market determined price.</p>
  <p>According  to (Rangarajan, 2012) the price of all  domestic gas in India should be determined through a formula linked to few  global indices. This was accepted by the empowered group of ministers, GoI, in  2013 with a slight modification as provided below </p>
  <p><u>Price of gas</u> = Simple Average of [P-India + P-Global]<br>
    <u>P-India</u> = Volume weighted producer net back price (at well  head of exporting countries) of term RLNG imported by India <br>
    <u>P-Global</u> = Volume weighted price of gas consumed in North  America (Henry Hub), Europe &amp; Russia (NBP) and Japan(producer net back  price or RLNG imports) </p>
  <p>The  above formulae which would have resulted in a gas price of 8+$/mmbtu (up from the  4.2$/mmbtu) at the beach was notified by the federal government in January 2014  and was to be applicable from April 01, 2014. However, with the change in the federal  government in May 2014 and based on the opposition to the price arising due to  the Rangarajan formula, the new government constituted another committee to  decide the pricing mechanism for domestic gas. The committee changed the  linkage to indices and recommended that the price of gas is to be determined  through volume weighted linkages to Henry Hub, National Balancing Point,  Alberta and Russian Hubs (Kelkar, 2014). However,  the above method is a simulated mechanism, in absence of allowing market, to  determine the gas prices. It could at best, be a proxy to the market till  government takes steps for its development. </p>
  <p>(Rangarajan, 2012) also  stated, since currently the competitive price for domestic gas does not exist  and may not be expected to come about for several more years, the gas pricing  policy will have to be based on searching from global trade transaction of gas  the competitive price of gas at the global level. However, the challenges while  determining prices through such proxy market measures are immense. Setting gas at  artificially low prices would dissuade risk capital in developing gas production  infrastructure thereby further lowering supply and accentuating gas shortages.  On the other hand, setting the price high runs the risk of being uncompetitive  against cheaper options such as coal thus ignoring affordability. A high  domestic price is also politically and socially unacceptable, as most of the  citizens feel entitled to benefit from the nation&rsquo;s natural gas resources.</p>
  <p>While  Indian government started reforms in the right direction by providing freedom (under  NELP round) to the producers, to determine gas prices through market mechanisms,  it has subsequently moved backwards by imposing riders on allocation of gas to  nominated segments of customers and formulating a price formulae from time to  time. The free market mechanism is further suppressed by the action of  government to subsidize the key gas consuming segments of power and fertilizer.  In the midstream and downstream sector the government took the right steps in  the year 2007 by establishing an independent regulator, but failed to provide  the regulator with the desired freedom due to political compulsions. Therefore it  can be established that there does not exist a market for gas in India. The current  Indian gas market is artificially created through government interventions manifested  with many distortions. Table 1 summarizes the Indian gas market. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img width="315" height="568" src="1_State_of_Natural_Gas_Sector_in_India_Vol_IV_Issue_IV_image010.png" align="left">The current state of Indian gas market as described  above indicates that the current market, which exists, is definitely not  efficient. In order to proceed ahead and establish the need, for development of  an efficient and sustainable gas market, we need to understand the actions  taken by the Government of India since opening up of Indian markets (economic  reforms) and reconnoitering the reasons since, the actions were not able to address  market failures. The theoretical framework used for the purpose of this study is  the theory of economic reforms and the practical framework is the learnings  from key developed markets of US and UK.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a name="_Toc369818228">Theory of economic reform and efficient gas markets</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Indian  government, as deliberated in the previous sections, did embark on a path of  reform but, lost direction somewhere both in its intent, and certainly on the direction,  to be followed to reform the entire energy sector. </p>
  <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Pillars of  economic reforms and path followed by Government of India</em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>The three pillars of economic reforms are </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Liberalisation</li>
    <li>Privatisation </li>
    <li>Globalisation </li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Fernando, 2013) </p>
  <p>Liberalisation,  the first pillar generally includes measures by government to decontrol and eliminate  license for business activities. Major industries are free from government  licensing and have free access to capital markets. Any restriction on movement,  sale and purchase of goods are removed and tax structures are simplified. As  described in the last section, GoI as part of it liberalization measures, did  allow 100% foreign direct Investment and initiated international competitive  bidding in the gas chain. </p>
  <p>Privatisation,  the second pillar does not necessarily only means transfer of ownership from  government to private enterprises. Privatisation also means that market forces  are allowed to take care of decisions of production, trade, distribution and  consumption. Decisions are made by private economic units while government  would require regulation at this stage to prevent any abuse of market power by  large companies. GoI, has shown intentions to privatise, but has not done  enough under this stage i.e. transferred ownership in few cases but not allowed  market forces to function.</p>
  <p>Globalisation,  the third and most important pillar means global integration of products,  technology, labour, investment, information as well as culture. Globalisation  tends to open up new business opportunities and encourages efficiencies through  healthy competition. Incremental differences in prices, wage rates and interest  rates tend to narrow down among economies while government keeps a check on  dumping by large economic forces.</p>
  <p>The  Indian government initiated the process of economic reforms in the year 1991,  compelled by ballooning fiscal deficit and balance of payment crisis. The  reforms included freedom from licensing, controls and inspector raj. This was  achieved by controlling the fiscal deficit through measures like macroeconomic  stabilization (demand side management) and structural reforms (supply side  management). Measure taken to manage demand included controlling inflation,  fiscal adjustment and balance of payment adjustment while supply side  management was done through managing trade and capital flows, Industrial  deregulation, divestment and public enterprise reforms and financial sector  reforms.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The  first generation of reforms in India focused on deregulation to dismantle  central planning and put an end to inappropriate interventions by the  government. In the second generation of reforms there is the positive agenda of  constructing state structures and address market failures.</p>
  <p>India  has to large extent reformed the products market but has failed to reform the  factors market. The removal of industrial and import licensing in 1991 was  among the first steps towards reforming the product markets in India. Markets  for manufactured products (although not agriculture products including  Fertilizer) were liberalized giving firms the ability to produce, buy and sell  surplus inputs and outputs. Price controls like those on steel and cement were  removed, but price controls on energy markets remain to a large extend. However  factors market such as those for labour, land and capital remain largely  unreformed, acting as stumbling block on doing business in India (ease of doing  business). &nbsp;</p>
  <p>Thus,  the theoretical framework can be used to argue that the best interest of both  consumers and the suppliers is served if the markets are efficient. However it  would be necessary to study the evolution of markets in developed markets of US  and UK to understand the key interventions which would help Indian market to  develop into an efficient market. </p>

  <p>In order to understand the changes required in the  Indian gas market, to evolve, from the current stage of oligopoly and monopoly to  a fully developed stage, the evolution of most developed market of United  States and United Kingdom is studied. Market in US has seen major developments over  last 70 years starting from the passage of the Natural Gas Act in 1938 till  date. The evolution (year wise) of US market (Pierce,  2004); (Juris, Development of competitive  natural gas markest in the united states, 1998); (Smead, 2013); (Kim, 2014); (Vany, 1994) ; (Herbert,  1996); (GAO, 2006) is presented in  Table 2;</p>

  <p><strong><u>The key learnings from the US and UK market are</u></strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A  strong and independent regulator must for a vibrant market; US and UK  regulators have made mistakes but have made course corrections as their markets  evolved, as evident from table 2 and table 3.</li>
    <li>Promoting  infrastructure development key for any market to develop. US, have 4.92 lakh  kms of wide diameter, high pressure pipelines and 30 major market hubs  including Henry Hub in Louisiana. In comparison, India can boost of just 15,000  kms of pipeline and no trading hub.</li>
    <li>Prices  and rates at source of supply need to be deregulated for attracting investments  (wellhead for producers and LNG terminals for imported gas). The success of US  market is evident from the fact that after undergoing numerous policy changes,  they have today more than 20 major gas producers (in addition to 6800  independent producers). India in comparison have just handful of producers.</li>
    <li>Limited  control over re-gas terminals helps higher investment</li>
    <li>Open  and transparent access to cross country pipelines must for any competition.  Open access in India exists but it cannot have its impact without adequate  coverage. </li>
    <li>Unbundling  of ownership of pipeline with shipping activity prerequisite to remove hurdles  on open access</li>
    <li>Promoting  transparency (no information asymmetry in the market) must for helping develop  markets which are efficient.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conclusion and Recommendations<strong> </strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
  <p>There exists a need for  development of an efficient gas market in India. The need is supported by the  following facts<br>
    Contribution of gas in primary energy mix of India is projected to  increase from current 7.1% to 20 % in next 15 years. This is in line with the  current world average of 24%. In addition, the GoI envisages  significant increase in per capita energy consumption from 0.5toe presently to  1.2toe by 2030 (against world average of 1.8toe) of energy consumption.To achieve this, supply from domestic and/or imported  (pipeline or LNG route) sources have to increase many times in the next two decades.  This would require huge investments in gas chain in  the next 10 yrs. Investment can only be attracted through right policy measures  and price signals from the market, as evident from learnings of US and UK.<br>
    The Indian gas market is still at early stage of development (as per  path traversed by UK and US) and it does not have any comprehensive and  integrated plan, on the path to be traversed from current stage to a fully  liquid and efficient gas market stage. Government has provided adhoc remedies  by artificial linkage of gas price to various indices which may not reflect the  true economic value of gas in India. GoI acknowledge that this is an interim  measure but does not provide mechanisms to move towards the fully developed  market state. The current measures are hindering investments by not sending the  correct price signals for development of a gas market in India. Different arms  of Government like downstream regulator and MoPNG work in isolation and have  brought in measures like opens access to help develop markets but the same will  not be sufficient and a more integrated approach is required.<br>
    A well developed and  functioning natural gas markets in India that would deliver reliable, efficient  and competitively priced energy is vital to achieve the growth of Indian  economy. This is not achievable without a plan for policy interventions from  the government. The key policy changes to be undertaken for development of an  efficient gas market can be enumerated based on the current phase of Indian  market, the status of US and UK markets and the path traversed by both US and  UK policy makers to reach to a stage where gas on gas competition has emerged. </p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li><em>The key policy interventions  required based on above learnings is outlined below</em></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>India, need to set  itself, on a course correction regarding the policy interventions required by  the government of India. Some of the key measures which can be taken by the GoI,  in order to help develop an efficient gas market are</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deregulate gas prices at well head. Wellhead regulation was the key  reason for high demand and scarcity of gas in US. Market price of gas will send  the appropriate price signals for investments in the sector.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Institute an independent and strong regulator for the entire gas chain&ndash;  Director General of Hydrocarbon is currently only an arm of MoPNG, while PNGRB  does not enjoy substantial powers.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Promote development of cross country pipeline. A well-developed network  is a pre-requisite for any market to develop and take shape. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Monopoly and monopsony powers of large public sectors firms need to be broken.&nbsp; Develop robust open access norms to remove  impediments on open access on pipelines. Promote transparency and post  development of pipelines unbundle the ownership and shipping activity. This  would help develop shippers who help in market creation. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The above steps are  complex to implement and hence, should be planned before implementation, to  provide a phased approach to the whole process. The US and UK took decades to  develop their gas markets, but India using the rich learnings offered these  countries, can develop its gas market in next ten to fifteen years.</p>
