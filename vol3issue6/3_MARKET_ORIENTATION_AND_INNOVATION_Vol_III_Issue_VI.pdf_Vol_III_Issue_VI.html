<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between two crucial strategies innovation and market orientation, a firm could adopt for the sustainable competitive advantage. By examining  the three factors of market orientation and three types of innovation, this paper seeks to identify the key factor of market orientation that are are related to innovation strategies of  the firm. Correlation analysis was undertaken on data from a survey of 170 manufacturing firms in the commercial hub of Pakistan, Karachi Industrial area. A self-administered survey was carried out and information was obtained from the top management of the firms, who are involved in major organizational strategies with respect to marketing and innovation. Innovation was found to be positively correlated to market orientation (customer orientation, competitor orientation and inter-functional co-ordination). These findings further suggest that firm innovation and firm market orientation are strategic reactions to changes in the firm’s competitive environment and therefore should lead to higher firm’s performance.</p>

  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction </h1>
  <p>The current business  environment of the world presents many challenges to organizations to determine  whether they meet the challenges and develop strategies to sustain their  position in the competitive environment. Responding to the external factors and  adopt products/services and marketing strategies is therefore crucial for an  organization to justify their strong position in the marketplace [<a href="#1">1</a>],&nbsp;[<a href="#Kot06">2</a>] <br>
    Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) represent a large,  diverse and important sector in both advanced market economies and economies in  transition. UNIDO reports that SMEs make up over 90 per cent of businesses  worldwide and account for between 50 to 60 percent of worldwide employment &nbsp;[<a href="#Org02">3</a>].<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="#Pel00">4</a>],  argued that it is particularly necessary for SMEs in  industrial establishments and export-oriented sector in developing or emerging  countries to know which strategy would be effective under these global business  environments? Peter Drucker answered this question far back in 1954, &ldquo;that  there is only one valid definition of business purpose and that is to create a  customer&rdquo;. It is the customer who determines what business an organization  should engage in. As the purpose of the business is to create customers, any  firm has only two and only two basic functions; marketing and [<a href="#Sch05">5</a>]<br>
    .<br>
    Consistent with the argument of [<a href="#Dru94">6</a>] to survive  and succeed in the context of a global and competitive business environment,  companies need to know their customers and the markets. They should be actively  involved in a regular stream of innovations [<a href="#Mar03">7</a>].  In this paper, an attempt has been made to examine the relationship of market  orientation and innovation strategies of the SMEs in garments/textile sector of  Pakistan to exactly know the behavior of the two vital strategies and their  implications. </p>
  <h1>research  motivation</h1>
  <p>[<a href="#Nar90">8</a>], found the positive  relationship between market orientation and business profitability in big  firms, and consistent with the same context, [<a href="#Jaw93">9</a>]  documented the empirical evidence of positive relationship between market  orientation and firm performance in large firms. Similarly, some recent studies  also reported a positive and significant relationship between market  orientation and firm performance&nbsp;[<a href="#Kes06">10</a>], [<a href="#Cal02">11</a>].  However, relatively less attention has been paid to this relationship between  market orientation and innovation, as the marketing literature has only  recently begun to acknowledge the role of innovation in the context of market  orientation &nbsp;[<a href="#ODw09">12</a>],&nbsp;[<a href="#Jon08">13</a>]&nbsp;[<a href="#Low07">14</a>]. &nbsp;This study therefore, focused on market  orientation and its relationship with innovation strateg<a name="_GoBack"></a>ies  in SMEs</p>
  <h1>literature  review-conceptual framework</h1>
  <p>Market Orientation<br>
    While  there has been some differentiation in the literature on the use of marketing  orientation versus market orientation, initially the term marketing orientation  was adopted to refer to the implementation of the marketing concept as defined  by [&nbsp;[<a href="#McC91">15</a>]. The traditional  emphasis of marketing orientation was customer oriented, focusing on consumer  needs and making profits by creating customer satisfaction [<a href="#Kot06">2</a>].  Market orientation, on the other hand, is a more recently utilized term for  instituting the marketing concept. A basic set of definition of concept  (research design elements) for this study is discussed and derived from [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>],&nbsp;[<a href="#Sla94">16</a>]. [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>],  emphasized that market orientation is the organizational culture that most  effectively creates the necessary behaviors for the creation of superior value  for buyers (customer) and thus, continuous superior performance for the  business. This philosophy basically is an implementation of marketing concept,  creating superior value to customers through three combined behaviors; customer  orientation, competition orientation and interfunctional coordination.<br>
    Customer  Orientation:<strong> </strong>a set of organizational  activities which ensue to learn and understand about the consumer behavior and  able to increase the benefits to the target customers in response to consumer  changing demands and satisfy their demands [<a href="#Jaw93">9</a>],  [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>].<br>
    Competitor  Orientation: a set of organizational activities and behaviors to understand the  short term as well as long term strengths and weaknesses of the existing and  potential competitors [<a href="#Ass88">17</a>],  [<a href="#Por85">18</a>].  This behavior of the organization should, therefore, focus on to development of  capacity to better perform than the competitors to ensure that target customers&rsquo;  current and future needs are met and satisfied [<a href="#Luk00">19</a>],  [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>].<br>
    Interfunctional Coordination:  is the set of activities and behavior that relies upon the interdependence of  each functional area in the organization to ensure that the firm resources  (human and martial) are utilized in such a way to create value and benefits to  the customers or buyers [<a href="#Por85">18</a>].  This behavior also emphasizes that organization wide strategy should be  developed to disseminate information about market and customers among all the  employees and departments in the firm, which will result in developing better  strategy to response to all market information and hence, effectively target  the market through providing value and benefits to customers.</p>
  <p>Innovation<br>
    [<a href="#Wee04">20</a>],  defined innovation as &ldquo;application of ideas that are new to the firm to create  added value, either directly for the enterprise or indirectly for the  customers, regardless of whether the newness and the added value are embodied  in products, processes, work organization or management, or marketing systems&rdquo;. <br>
    <a name="_Toc194630057"></a><a name="_Toc194629760">This study focuses on the innovation that is more related to  manufacturing firms, and therefore, the development of product innovation  complemented by strategy and process innovation is considered important  innovations activities in manufacturing firms, particularly in the textile  sector.</a><a name="_Toc194630058"></a><a name="_Toc194629761"> Innovation in manufacturing sectors can be  better understood by the three dimensions proposed by </a> [<a href="#Hen01">21 </a>] , product  innovation, strategy innovation and process innovation. <a name="_Toc194630059"></a><a name="_Toc194629762"> </a><br>
    First,  the innovation concept has frequently been researched from a product innovation  perspective. This can be separated into voluntary product innovation and  obligatory product innovation. Following those of  [<a href="#Tor90">22 </a>] ,  voluntary innovations are promoted and disseminated by the company itself,  whilst obligatory innovations are imposed by legal, competitive, and  environmental forces, and they do not always meet with approval from the  different collectives within the company. An example of this would be the need  to review the composition or packaging of products for legal reasons when they  are being introduced in new countries or in domestic markets.</p>
  <p>Second, strategy  innovation has been studied in-depth and two approaches can be identified, that  are radical strategy innovations and incremental strategy innovations  &nbsp;[<a href="#Tor90">22 </a>] ,  [<a href="#Hax">23 </a>] . The  former is real changes for the organization and required significant changes in  business practice, while incremental innovations may be carried out with  minimum change, commitment and risk, maintaining the same strategy. Radical  innovations are the least safe as they imply a greater proportion of  experimentations, and interactive problem solving that requires greater  flexibility and a higher learning curve from the organization&rsquo;s owners and  managers. Incremental innovations are safer and imply a larger percentage of  planning and execution, thus requiring greater efficiency and understanding.</p>
  <p><a name="_Toc194630061"></a><a name="_Toc194629764">Third, there is  process innovation. The difference is that if product innovation is what we  create, and strategy innovation is what we should do to create it, process  innovation reflects what we have been available to do that. In summation,  process innovations include among other aspects, issues relating to new skills  and abilities, a greater concern for market orientation and the development of  interdepartmental communication </a> [<a href="#Hen01">21 </a>] .  Usually process innovation leads products and strategy innovation, given that  what we create (product innovation) is the result of what we &ldquo;do&rdquo; to create it  (strategy innovation) and of what we &ldquo;have&rdquo; to do to create it (process  innovation).</p>
  <p>Market Orientation and  Innovation<br>
    Traditionally, market orientation literature  has identified positive relationships between market orientation and  innovation-related aspects. [<a href="#Koh90">24</a>],  [<a href="#Des93">25</a>]  and [<a href="#Sla94">16</a>]  suggested that market oriented behavior results in a higher degree of  innovation, and therefore of success in the commercialization of new products.<br>
    [<a href="#Hur98">26</a>]  and [<a href="#Jon08">13</a>]  recommend the inclusion of innovation in the concept of market orientation and  indicated that market orientation and innovation complement each other. In line  with [<a href="#Jaw93">9</a>]  conceptual framework of market orientation, they pointed out that market  orientation has to do absolutely with new and different action plans in order  to respond to market conditions. Similarly, [<a href="#Han">27</a>], [<a href="#Lad01">28</a>]  obtained similar results. [<a href="#Han">27</a>] concluded that both  global market orientation and its different components have a positive and  significant effect on technological and administrative innovations. </p>
  <p>In turn, these innovations  affect company profitability positively. [<a href="#Lad01">28</a>]  also showed empirically that the level of market orientation has a positive  effect on innovation in the financial sector. They also observed that the  greater the company&rsquo;s market orientation, the higher the ratio of new products  in comparison to its competitors. However, they added that although no direct  effect on the profitability of innovations is observed, the company receives  more media impact because of its degree of involvement in product innovation.<br>
    A recent study by [<a href="#Luk00">19</a>], analysis the  relationship between market orientation and one of the components of  innovation; product innovation. The study concentrates on American industry and  shows how product innovation varies proportionally with the company&rsquo;s  involvement in market orientation. They observed that customer orientation  increases the commercialization of new products, competitor orientation reduces  the launching of extensions to a product and new product lines, and interfunctional  coordination increases the commercialization of extensions to product lines.<br>

  <p>In conclusion, and based on [<a href="#Lad01">28</a>] and [<a href="#Hen01">21</a>] recent studies,  market orientation influences and precede innovation, and as a result companies  who is more market-oriented show a greater innovative flair. The above findings  revealed positive direct relationship between firm performance and market  orientation, positive relationship between innovation and market orientation,  and a positive link between innovation and firm performance in large  organizations. <br>
    Hypotheses<strong> </strong><br>
    Does  market orientation in SMEs of Pakistan drive innovation? The influences and  effect or association of market orientation constructs on innovation have been  recognized to be crucial. [<a href="#Hur98">26</a>]  made a recommendation for incorporating to construct related to innovation into  research on market orientation.&nbsp; [<a href="#Koh90">24</a>], viewed market  orientation as continuous innovative behavior because market orientation  involves innovative strategies and activities in response to changes in  customer needs, particularly and market changes in general. However, [<a href="#Jaw93">9</a>] model of market  orientation did not include the construct of innovation in their study.<br>
    Since market orientation of the firm focuses on the three  important behavior of the organization, particularly to customer orientation,  it is argued that firms tend to involve in innovation activities to respond to  the customer demands through product or service innovation, offering more  values and benefits to customer. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed:</p>
  <p>Hypothesis:  Three factors of market orientation (customer orientation, competitor  orientation and interfunctational coordination) of SMEs have significant  association with three types of Innovation (product innovation, process  innovation and strategy innovation).</p>
  <h1>research  methods</h1>
  <p>The research design was a  cross-sectional, field based study of 170 small and medium-sized manufacturer  of textiles and garments business in the city of Karachi. A field survey method  with structured questionnaire was developed and conducted to gather the primary  data from the textile/garment firms in small and medium sized sector. This  study used three main survey instruments of market orientation, innovation, and  firm profile. </p>
  <p>In applying the market-orientation concept to  SMEs, the instrument was based upon the elements of [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>], which view  market-orientation as cultural and behavioral processes and the activities  associated with creating and satisfying customers by continually assessing  their needs and wants to increase business performance. &nbsp;Market  orientation instrument is the original revised version of [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>] business survey  questionnaire. Fourteen original items were intended to measure small  and medium sized owner/managers&rsquo; level of market orientation. The items were  borrowed and modified from the original work of [<a href="#Nar90">8</a>].&nbsp; These items were rated on a five&ndash;point Likert  type scale. <br>
    To measure  firm&rsquo;s innovation, a pool of items was included based on a scale proposed by [<a href="#Hen01">21</a>]. These authors  synthesize the innovation construct by using 24 items, distributed in four  sub-scales, namely; innovation in products, innovation in processes, and  innovation in strategy.<br>
    In Table 2, alpha scores of all variables  with completed response of 170 owner/ managers of small and medium sized firms  in Pakistan are given.&nbsp; The dimensions of  market orientation and innovation were computed and presented as summated  average score measures for that specific variable. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ** Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level  (2-tailed)</p>
  <p>Analysis  of the data resulted from the Pearson correlation analysis (Table 3), indicates  that hypothesis, customer orientation has significant association with product  innovation (PRODUCT INNOVATION), strategy innovation (STRATEGY INNOVATION), and  process innovation (PROCESS INNOVATION). The correlation statistics reveals  that the strength of association of customer orientation is moderately high and  positive with product innovation (R=.567). However the strength of association  is found high and positive with strategy innovation (R=.686) as well as with  the process innovation (R=.644). Therefore, customer orientation and its  strength of association with product, strategy and process innovations are high  and positive. This indicates that in the SME textile sector, customer  orientation has a relatively stronger relationship with the three types of innovation  in the firm.<br>
    In contrast, competitor orientation in hypothesis, despite  displaying significant positive association with the three types of innovation,  the strength of association is small or low, yet definite between competitor  orientation and product innovation (R=.335). However, competitor orientation  has moderate and significant association with the other two types of  innovation, process innovation (R=.427) and strategy innovations (R=.534).&nbsp; <br>
    While, competitor orientation on the other hand reports a  significantly positive and moderate association with product innovation  (R=.494), with strategy innovation (R=.531) and with process innovation  (R=.554). Therefore hypotheses of this study are supported.</p>
  <h1>discussion  and conclusion</h1>
  <p>There are many previous studies indicating  that market orientation and innovation adopted in the firms had a confirmed  positive relationship, and market orientation also influenced innovation  activities in the manufacturing and service firms [<a href="#Luk00">19</a>],  [<a href="#Har97">29</a>].  This study also hypothesized that there were significant association between  the three behavioral components of marker orientation and the three innovations  strategies in small and medium sized textile/garments manufacturing firms. To  examine the relationship, correlation matrix result indicated that three  components of market orientation, that is, customer orientation, competitor  orientation and interfunctional coordination had significant and positive  associations with the three types of innovations strategies in the  textile/garments manufacturing SMEs. However, the result also indicated that  competitor orientation had relatively low but definite association with product  innovation and significantly moderate association with the strategy and process  innovation. In contrast to competitor orientation, interfunctional and customer  orientation correlation statistics revealed that both of these market orientation  components had significantly high association with all the three innovation  strategies in the textile manufacturing SMEs. These results of correlation  therefore signified that the increase of market orientation behavior leads to  higher level of innovations in the SMEs. To determine which component of the  market orientation had significantly effect in terms of causing variability  onto overall level of innovation practice, it was practical to do the  regression analysis to reveal the relationship between the variables, and to  investigate which market orientation construct significantly estimated variance  on firm&rsquo;s innovation activities.<br>
    According to these  statistics, customer orientation and interfunctional coordination are two of  the important internal resources or capability a firm must develop to benefit  their customers through series of innovation strategies. Product innovation is  recognized as one of the most realistic response against customer orientation.  Firms with greater level of market orientation would certainly pose competent  capabilities (process innovation) to develop new strategies (strategy  innovation) and to create new products (product innovation). [<a href="#Dru94">6</a>],  argued that if the firms need to be more competitive in a relatively  competitive environment, they have to be more customer oriented, have detailed  perspective of the market as well as being innovative. Since the present  business environment is becoming more complex and more global oriented, it is  therefore crucial for a business in SME manufacturing sector in developing  economies, to engage in more innovations to avoid failure and sustain  competitive advantage.</p>
