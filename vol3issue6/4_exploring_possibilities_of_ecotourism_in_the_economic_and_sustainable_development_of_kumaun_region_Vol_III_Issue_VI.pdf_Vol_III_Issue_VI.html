  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>Ecotourism  intends to achieve economic growth and development along with the preservation  of the environment. It is a part of nature based tourism which aims to develop  a region economically with various eco-friendly programmes and activities with  an intention of preserving cultural integrity of local people and particularly,  the environment. It is tourism aiming economic development through protecting  biodiversity.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecotourism = &ldquo;Tourism+ Economic  Development + Environmental Conservation&rdquo;<br>

    Ecotourism  and related small-scale, entrepreneurial tourism businesses visualize  possibilities for combining rural value-capture with economic, social and  ecological sustainability (Marsden and Smith, 2005)1.&nbsp; Thus, ecotourism can preserve ecological and  cultural environment of a region. Further, it can also contribute in green  growth by promoting energy and water conservation and can also create economic  opportunities for local communities. It has therefore, proven to be a powerful  incentive for conservation in many parts of the world. (Ban Ki-moon, 2012 )2<br>
    Ecotourism  is identified as the fastest growing sector of the global tourism industry  (Roberts and Thanos, 2003)3. The growing economic and national importance of  this kind of tourism has, over the last few years attracted the attention of most  governments around the world, and particularly, those of developing countries.  Accordingly, in India, the Ministry of Tourism has shown tremendous interest in  promoting ecotourism in the country in a responsible and sustainable manner4.  With this mandate, in the year 2011, the Ministry prepared Sustainable Tourism  Criteria and Indicators for hotels, tour operators and other stakeholders.  Further, it has also developed criteria and indicators for rural tourism and  home-stays. Besides these, the following principles were also formulated to  guide initiatives of Ministry of Tourism for promoting ecotourism in India;<br>
    a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Involvement of local community for  overall economic development of an area.<br>
    b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolution of conflicts between resources  utilised for ecotourism and livelihood of local inhabitants.<br>
    c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compatibility of type and scale of  ecotourism development with the environment and socio-cultural characteristics  of the local community, and<br>
    d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall area development strategy, guided  by an integrated land-use plan avoiding inter-sectoral conflicts and ensuring  sectoral integration, associated with commensurate expansion of public  services.<br>
    These  principles have been laid-down to establish an ideal balance between tourist  numbers without sacrificing with natural and cultural heritage. With these  directives, the Government of Uttarakhand has also initiated for promoting  ecotourism as an endeavour of the ten-year &lsquo;Green India&rsquo; plan. A wing has also  been created by the State Government to draft policies and to provide funding  for various eco-tourism projects. With this mandate, Centre for Ecotourism and  Sustainable Livelihood&nbsp; has also been  established near Corbett Tiger Reserve by the Forest Department of Uttarakhand.  Further, Uttarakhand Tourism Development Master Plan (2007-2022) has recognized  the importance of ecotourism and sustainable development5.&nbsp; But still, implementation of these ecotourism  initiatives in Uttarakhand is still in a very nascent stage.</p>
  <h1>Need  of Study</h1>
  <p>Ecotourism  have a huge potential in contributing sustainable development of Uttarakhand by  providing socio-economic benefits to local communities together with preserving  physical, cultural and environmental heritage.&nbsp;  Uttarakhand which is renowned for its great Himalayan mountain range,  forests, and rivers have many tourist destinations which may allure tourist  from all over the world. But, due to the catastrophe that took place in the  State, domestic and foreign tourists are hesitant in visiting tourist  destinations. Further, the livelihood of the people involved in tourism has  been ruined by the natural calamity that hit the State last year.&nbsp; Consequently, the business from tourism has  been reduced to 20 to 30 percent due the floods and landslides. Therefore,  there is an urgent need to explore the possibilities for reviving confidence of  tourists towards Uttarakhand and for bringing domestic and international  tourist to the State. In this perspective ecotourism can be used as a strategic  tool for enhancing income generation of the local community with the true  intention of conserving biodiversity.<br>
    Thus,  this paper attempts to identify various potential eco-tourism destinations in  the Kumaun Region. Further, it also attempts to explore potential of ecotourism  in the local capacity building and sustainable development through eco-tourist  destinations of Kumaun Region.</p>
  <h2>Eco-tourism</h2>
  <p>Ecotourism  means travelling to the undisturbed natural areas with the minimal impact on  environment and local culture. It involves visiting the places which are close  to nature without much disturbing flora and fauna of that region. As per oxford  dictionary, eco tourism is a tourism directed towards exotic natural  environments, intended to support conservation efforts and observe wildlife.  Initially, it was defined by Ceballos-Lascurian (1987) as &lsquo;travelling to  relatively undisturbed and uncontaminated natural areas with the specific  objective of studying, admiring, and enjoying the scenery and its wild plants  and animals, as well as any existing cultural manifestations (both past and  present) found in these areas&rsquo;6.&nbsp; A  subsequent definition is given by Goodwin in which he identified key criteria  for ecotourism that includes activities which must be environmentally and culturally  sensitive and these must directly benefit conservation and local people who in  turn have an incentive for conservation and these must be self sustaining  within the context of the natural and cultural habitats in which it takes  place. (Goodwin 1996)7. <br>
    Further,  in the recent years it has been elaborately explained by the IUCN&rsquo;s Eco tourism  programme as &ldquo;environmentally responsible travel and visitation to relatively  undisturbed natural areas, in order to enjoy and appreciate nature (and any  accompanying cultural features &ndash;both past and present) that promotes  conservation, has lower visitor impact, and provides for beneficially active  socio-economic involvement local populations&rdquo;. (Ceballos-Lascurian H. 1996)  8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, ecotourism has been  defined very differently by Ecotourism Kenya (EK), as &ldquo;the involvement of  tourists in environmental conservation activities directly linked to addressing  human development needs, and promotes equitable sharing of benefits accrued  from tourism with local communities while supporting their nature conservation  values.&rdquo;9<br>
    Ecotourism  has also been studied in different perspectives. For example, Farrel and Runyan  in year 1991 even distinguished it with the nature tourism and has described it  as more exclusively purposeful and focused on the enhancement or maintenance of  natural systems10. Higham has seen it as a subset of sustainable tourism, as it  complies with the principles of sustainable development (Higham 2007)11. This  becomes evident in the discussion by Kruger (2005), who wrote that the rise of  interest in ecotourism can be largely attributed to the rise of the term  sustainability12. It has also been studied with Adventure and Culture and has  been interpreted to include nature tourism in the broader perspective (Fennell,  1999) 13.<br>
    In  nutshell, ecotourism is travelling to the places which are relatively  undisturbed natural areas for enjoying and appreciating nature and culture as  well as garnering positive benefits, both for the environment and the local  communities visited.</p>
  <h1>Objective  of the Study</h1>
  <p>The objectives  of the present study are;</p>
  <h2>To  identify the potential tourist destinations for eco-tourism in Kumaun region of  Uttarakhand</h2>
  <h2>To  explore potential of ecotourism in the local capacity building and suistanable  development of Kumaun Region.</h2>
  <h2>To  suggest various steps for promoting ecotourism in the Kumaun region.</h2>
  <p>This  paper empirically examines the local communities based ecotourism in an  interpretive and naturalistic way.</p>
  <h1>Potential  of Eco-Tourism in Kumaun Region</h1>
  <p>Kumaun  is a renowned for its vast natural resources, majestic Himalayas, soaring and  enthralling Pine and Deodar trees and serene places of worship,&nbsp; surely make it as &lsquo; Dev-Bhumi&rsquo; i.e. Abode of  Gods&rsquo;. Kumaun has a rich and old tradition and culture which offers variety of  fairs, festivals and revels in Kumaun. It includes districts of Almora,  Bageshwar, Champawat, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Udham Singh Nagar. It shares  its border by Tibet in North, Nepal on the East, Garhwal on the West and South  by Uttar Pradesh. <br>
    Climate  and topography of Kumaun offers tremendous opportunities for the people who  wish to ensure that their holiday creates positive benefits, both for the  environment and the local communities visited.&nbsp;  The same has been affirmed by Bhatt Abha (1996) &ldquo;Today, when the  town-dweller is caught up in the mind-numbing pressures of the jet-age, the  hills beckon for a&nbsp; fascinating  re-discovery of our roots, untouched by pollution and hurly-burly of urban  life, waiting to open vistas of nature in its pristine, glory, leaving an  unforgettable imprint on the mind of visitor.&rdquo;14 Further, Kumaun experiences  varying climatic conditions all throughout the year which add to opportunities  for eco-tourists. Thus, Kumaun could be best described as extremely interesting  place for eco-tourism.<br>

    <strong>Identified places for establishing  eco-hubs and ethnic villages in Kumaun</strong><br>
    Keeping  in mind the&nbsp; scope of eco-tourism in the  region, the following places are identified as major places where eco-hubs or  ethnic villages can be established in Kumaun. These are Ranikhet, Almora,  Bageshwar, Baijnath, Someshwar, Kapkot, Gangolihat, Pithoragarh&nbsp; and Didihat. These places have tremendous  potential of attracting tourist in the Kumaun region of Uttarakhand without  much eroding its natural or cultural assets. Not only it will help in revenue  generation but will also help in providing employment and business  opportunities to the unemployed people in the State.<br>

  <h1>Exploring  potential of eco-tourism in the local capacity building and suistanable  development of kumaun region</h1>
  <p>Economically,  ecotourism in Kumaun is of great importance, especially at uphills where  incomes avenues are meager; it can make significant contribution to  livelihoods. In remote areas, there are usually fewer income generating  alternatives and ecotourism can lend a hand in diversifying the economic status  of the local community. Consequently, it can also assist in reducing migration  of youth from the hills to urban areas.<br>
    The  ecotourism opportunities which can supplement in local capacity building and  sustainable development of Kumaun are explored as under;</p>
  <h2>Eco-packages Tours and Camps</h2>
  <p>Ecotourism <br>
    Eco-tourism  activities in the form of eco-package tours and camps can magnify potential  revenues of tourism operators, planners and administrators in the region.  Centre for Ecotourism and Sustainable Livelihoods have initiated in organizing  eco-camps at Choti Haldwani, Bhimtal, Munsyari and Maheshkhan, but the same  needs to be replicated to other prime locations of Kumaun. Tourism operators  and planners in the region can act as eco-entrepreneurs in planning and  organising ecotours with the local community. Participative management with the  local community will not only improve ecosystem and environmental conditions of  these places but will also yield substantial revenues. The places where eco  camps can be organised are Pawalgarh, Dhauladevi, Dalar, Risal, Didihat,  Kausani, Marchula, Manila, Chilianaula,Dhunaghat, Lohaghat,Madkote and  Pancheshwar.<br>
    Further,  tourism operators like KMVN and Forest Department, individually as well as  collaboratively may organise eco camps in the picturesque locations of  Ranikhet, Someshwar, Bageshwar and Pithoragarh. Further, National Parks and  wild life sanctuaries like Pawalgarh, Binsar and Nandhaur&nbsp; should be developed as the&nbsp; eco-clusters especially to attract  international tourists in the region..</p>
  <h2>Accessibility of eco-hubs to the  tourist</h2>
  <p>Eco  fragile areas should be easily accessible and available to the eco-visitors. It  is observed that the transport and communications network in Kumaun is  fragmented and costly. <br>
    Therefore,  development of basic infrastructure, improvement of accommodation facilities  and availability of transport arrangements in eco-hubs at Kumaun would help in  attracting eco-travelers in the region.&nbsp;  However, this development should preserve the natural beauty of the  place without much affecting its flora and fauna. Additionally, creation of  traditional homes in eco hubs with the local community would definitely result  in earning extra income to the local people and would also provide  accommodation facilities to the travelers. The model of Choti Haldwani near  Corbett may be replicated in the places identified for promoting eco-tourism in  the region. Home-stays in traditional huts, celebrating rituals and festivals  with the local habitants, discovering of local habitats and wildlife with the  local people will help in generating extra income. Part of income so earned can  be ploughed back in funds for empowering local community for developing their  areas and will assist them in conserving environment. Further, these funds will  also provide support solutions to the native problems of the local communities.  It will also help them in rebuilding their areas quickly in case of any landslides  or disasters. Therefore, proper roads, basic utilities and health care  facilities shall be developed in these eco-hubs for providing safe and healthy  stay.<br>
    <img border="0" width="268" height="226" src="4_exploring_possibilities_of_ecotourism_in_the_economic_and_sustainable_development_of_kumaun_region_Vol_III_Issue_VI.pdf_Vol_III_Issue_VI_image011.jpg"> <br>
    <strong>Traditional houses in hilly areas  for offering home stays for tourists</strong></p>
  <h2>Involvement of local people in  eco-hubs</h2>
  <p>Ecotourism  can provide viable economic development alternatives for local communities with  various income-generating options and accordingly, local people should be  involved in ecotourism activities in numerous ways. The community-focused  approach of ecotourism will help in improving quality of life of local  inhabitants as well as will help in the conservation of the resources.  Association of local people with the tourists will also ameliorate tourist in  gaining experiences of hill&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;  Accordingly, the local community may be integrated in formulating  &lsquo;Ecotourism Promotion Committees&rsquo; in association with the NGO and SHG in  management of Home Stays and in providing facilities to the travelers.  Strategically, ecotourism can be promoted in Kumaun by picking up the following  key initiatives:<br>
    &#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foremost, Local Women (including senior  female members of the families called Aama) may be involved in promoting eco  tourism such as preparing local cuisine, mythological storytelling and  providing interactive workshops on handicrafts to the travelers.&nbsp; &nbsp;This  will attract tourists from various parts of the country as well as from foreign  countries.<br>
    <img border="0" width="292" height="219" src="4_exploring_possibilities_of_ecotourism_in_the_economic_and_sustainable_development_of_kumaun_region_Vol_III_Issue_VI.pdf_Vol_III_Issue_VI_image013.jpg"> <br>
    <strong>Involvement of Local Women</strong> <br>
    &#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eco tourism can also create additional  employment for local people as eco-tour guides, camp managers, sales  assistants, care takers, cooks and drivers. Therefore, capacity building  programmes in terms of trainings, short-term courses and workshops shall be  organised in eco-hubs for making local inhabitants competent enough in handling  the above capacities effectively. <br>
    &#61607;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interactive craft workshops like crafts  from Ringal, Candle making, Aipan art, Shawls, Wooden work etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; can be organized with the help of the local  community. This will help in promoting Kumaoni art and culture among the  tourists. <br>
    Further,  local haats and crafts fairs shall also be organised with the help of NGOs and  Cooperatives as they are very effective in attracting travelers for buying  rural art and crafts items and will also augment income generating  possibilities in the hilly areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <h2>Cultural carnivals, fairs and  festivals</h2>
  <p>Kumaun  have rich custom of celebrating functions and festivals that represents  religious, social and cultural pride of the region. These local and regional  festivals provides major source of recreation and entertainment through dance  performances, kumauni cuisine and exquisite Handicrafts. Thus, these will  definitely contribute to the tourist&rsquo;s acquaintances with the local aesthetic.<br>

    Nature  in Traditional ecotourism is developing towards a medium for self-fulfillment  (Gossling S. and Hultman J.,2006)15. Thus, nature based tourism provides an  opportunity to tourist to observe flora and fauna in their natural habitats. In  Kumaun, National Parks like Corbett, Nainital, Binsar , Wild Life Sanctuaries  like Pawalgarh, Nandhaur, Ascot and Binsar allows tourists to experience nature  reflexively.<br>
    There  are various terms that are related to ecotourism, some of them are identified  to promote ecotourism in the Kumaun region. </p>

  <h5>Suggestions </h5>
  <p>To suggest  a few, the following steps if taken may be an initiative towards eco-tourism;<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conducting  tourism awareness programme for larger communities would increase the footfalls  of the tourists to beautiful destinations.<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Sensitizing the frontline people about the eco responsibility may be another  step towards eco-tourism.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  steps may be taken to train the tour guides who actually act as a guardian to  the environment.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  visitors can also support the local business by purchasing the goods which are  locally produced.<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solar  light equipments may be used at the places which need to be conserved for  tourism.<br>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction  of toilets at the camping sites would help in preserving the environment and  keeping the place clean and hygienic.<br>
    7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publishing  hand-book containing the details of the local and regional culture of the destinations  and making them available to the traveler free of cost would be an ideal  solution.<br>
    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creation  of website advertising the local visiting spots and display of photographs  would also enhance the prospects of the tourists to visit such places.<br>
    9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local  camps at the unexplored areas would certainly result into adventurous tours and  would attract the tourists.<br>
    10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-stop  solution such as obtaining permission to visit the designated places from  competent authorities, providing&nbsp;  accommodation, facilitating transport arrangements with the help of bus/  taxi operators etc. would widen the scope of ecotourism in the region.<br>
    11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishment  of eco-museums at the prime locations of Kumaun will help in depicting the  culture and traditions of Kumaun and will also preserve traditional artistic  work, jewelry, treasures of historical importance etc.&nbsp; This will also give mythological insight into  the values and ancient traditions of the place.<br>
    12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Community participation in the  decision making process of tourism development will ensure sustainability and  acceptability of tourism in the untouched areas of Kumaun.</p>
  <h5>Discussion and Conclusion</h5>
  <p>The &ldquo;Green  Laws&rdquo; of conservation should be disseminated to the masses so that they may  realize that ecotourism is the way to maximise economic, environmental and  social benefits of tourism. Today, everyone is a stakeholder in the process of  conserving the environment and the same can be sustained when everyone shares  the equal responsibility. Ecotourism provides income-generating opportunities  to the local communities with an honest intention of conserving and preserving  ecology and culture, respectively. However, a planned and integrated approach  on the part of Government, NGO, Tourism Promoting Agencies and Local people is  essential in encouraging ecotourism for producing sound, economic, social and  environmental outcomes. Further, carrying capacities of the different  eco-regions have to be explored vis-&agrave;-vis influx of tourists in the main  eco-circuits. <br>
    Greater  Synergies among Forest Department, Vikas Nigams, and Government of Uttarakhand,  Uttarakhand Tourism Board, Eco-Vikas committees shall be needed. Thus, focused  approach for enterprising ecotourism in Kumaun&nbsp;  in relation with the natural environment is the need of an hour.</p>
