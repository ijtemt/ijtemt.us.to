Paper Title :<br>Developing a Framework for Exploring the Ontology of Information Technology (IT) Leadership:<br>
Toward an Integrated Theory of IT Leadership
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Leaders and managers who work in IT environment face challenges common to all academic and business leaders: rapidly changing technology, shrinking budgets, policy and legislative changes, globalization, private sector competition, a changing student population, and much more. Successful IT leaders must have the talents, qualities, perspectives, and political skills to support the institutional goals, strategic directions. In addition, they must be aware of trends in IT field and their implications over higher education. This research is an implication of the debate surrounding the current, widely accepted concept of IT leadership. Indeed, this concept is becoming less useful for demystifying leadership in IT organizations. In fact, there is a tendency amongst researchers in IT Leadership area to depict IT Leader as super intelligent, strategist, and a noble man. To illustrate, political leadership influenced our conceptualization of IT Leadership. Accordingly, the further development of IT leadership theory require for a further understanding of the ontological aspects of IT leadership. Based on a qualitative methodology, the research finds an alternative model for explaining the ontology of IT Leadership; this model is based on four principles. To improve the validity of the framework, the research tests it through a quantitative method. Arguably, these frameworks improve our understanding of IT leadership and stimulate the dialectical development of an integrated theory of IT Leadership.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The  introduction is divided into three sub-sections. Firstly, Section A. contains  background to the research. Secondly, section B. explores the relation between  strategic leadership and IT,&nbsp; section C.  explores the impact of IT leadership over organizations while section D.  explores the relation between higher Education institutes and leadership.</p>
  <h2>Background </h2>
  <p>Information  systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) leadership have evolved over the  past decade (Conger 1999 ; Severson, Blum-DeStefano&nbsp; and Asghar 2013). Despite of the directed  attention in recent years (Conger and Pearce, 2003;Drago-Severson. 2012),  little empirical research on IT leadership has been done. This research aims to  identify the relation between leadership and innovation in IT organizations.  The research contributes to a continuing research for examining the  characteristics and mechanisms of innovative IT leadership. <br>
    Leaders  have to act as agents of change (Murphy, 2002), egging the rest of the  executives on to follow. Fry (2003) regarded leadership as a motivation to  change and concluded that in order to motivate employees, leaders should  strengthen the fundamental values and transfer them to executives through  regulations and their personal actions. Studies have shown (Kirkman and Lowe,  2006; Joshi, Lazarova, and Liao 2009; Marinova, Moon, Dyne, 2010) that leaders  with merits such as motivation, and innovative stimulation are able to change  the executives&rsquo; values by reinforcing both personal and organisational change  and inspiring their executives to innovate. <br>
    Sitkin  et al.(2001) developed a generic model of leadership; in fact, they have  distinguished between leadership and management, although the same manager can  hold both kinds of responsibilities simultaneously. <br>
    According  to Sitkin et al.(2001), there are six keys to innovative leadership in  technological environment, each of which has its effects on organizational  performance: relational leadership engenders a sense of trust and justice,  personal leadership fosters loyalty, inspirational leadership elevates higher  aspirations, contextual leadership guides community building, supportive  leadership urges employees to develop self-discipline, and stewardship develops  an internalized sense of responsibility.<br>
    Levinson  (1976) concedes that there are implicit contracts between employees and  organizations.&nbsp; These unwritten contracts  are obligatory, and constitute the behavior and balance within the  organization. Moreover, if an employee&nbsp;  breaks&nbsp; that&nbsp; contract,&nbsp;  the&nbsp; other&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp;  react&nbsp; by a justified&nbsp; act of punishment. A good leader must detach  these kinds of relations amongst the employees. Indeed, with the absence of a  resourceful leader, these relations could flourish and hinder the  organizational performance.&nbsp;  Additionally, leaders must promote their vision and explain it to the  involved parties (Li, Tan and Teo, 2012). </p>
  <h2>Strategic  Leadership and IT</h2>
  <p>Strategic  leadership refers to a manager&rsquo;s ability to realize a strategic vision for the  institution (Hunter, 2010), and to inspire and convince others to embrace that  vision. Strategic leadership in context of IT can also be defined as taking  advantage of IT resources in supporting business strategy, and adding a value  to the business (Hanna, 2011). <br>
    Managing  change is decisive for IT divisions(Chou and Chou, 2009) and eventually there  is a growing demand for strategic leaders in IT who not only provide guidance and  direction, but who can also realize business values and implement change. </p>
  <h2>The  Impact of IT Leadership over Organisations</h2>
  <p>There is  a tendency amongst researchers to consider information systems leadership as a  main concern in IT Management (Dong, 2006; Nakayama and Sutcliffe, 2008). With  the complexity and contextual factors behind the success of information systems  within an organizational context, leaders openness to change is considered as  one of the main derivatives behind innovation in any IT organization.&nbsp; Indeed, the worst thing a leader can practice  is believe that they know everything, which is one of the most common practices  of information systems leaders (Conger 1999 and Murphy, 2002). <br>
    The  implications of this believe is the fact that leaders behave as they are really  know everything. Unfortunately, this practice bulks the development of new  solutions and ideas. Accordingly, the possibility for change and innovation  becomes difficult. Additionally, it is not enough for innovative leaders to be  only open to change; they must also possess the ability to persuade their staff  to understand why change is critical to their success. </p>
  <h2>Higher  Education Institute (HEI) and IT Leadership</h2>
  <p>Being a  strategic leader in academia requires appreciating business priorities (Lynn  and Baird, 2010) and their strategic and tactical goals, besides having a clear  vision on how IT can contribute to academic strategy. Working in the context of  the institutional strategy is one of the key elements of strategic leadership for  IT leaders. <br>
    Academic  leadership refers to leadership in an academic environment or institutions.  Indeed, academic institutions have different qualities than other business  organisations. Business organisations are derived by the need to maximise shareholder  value. On the other hand, public sector organisations are derived by the need  to maximise stakeholder&rsquo;s value, which includes community as a whole. In  academic settings, the beneficial stakeholders are such as community, students,  and staff. Thus, the stakeholders relations in academic settings are more  diverse. In fact, RAMSDEN (1998) and HARMAN (2002) have developed models to  address these issues.</p>
  <h1>Methodology </h1>
  <p>This  section is divided into two sub-sections. Firstly, Section A. explains the  limitations of this research while section B. explains the conceptual framework  in four detailed stages.</p>
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>This is  a mixed research study. Hence, the organization of this methodology makes it  possible for other researchers to authenticate the results or to add a  contribution to the basic premise of the study (Creswell, 1998). However, the  qualitative approach makes it difficult to generalize the findings from  business perspective (Li et al., 2009). Hence, testing it through questionnaire  is important to insure that the findings of this study are not limited to the  specific observations of the researcher and perceptions of the participants.</p>
  <h2>Conceptual  Framework</h2>
  <p>As indicated in figure 1, the conceptual framework is divided into  four stages:</p>

    the  conceptual framework for the research.</p>
</div>
<em><br clear="all">
</em>
<div>
  <h3>Stage  1, Literature review:</h3>
  <p>This  stage aims to provide a critical overview to IT Leadership area and to provide  a solid foundation for the research.</p>
  <h3>Stage  2, Qualitative Research to Generate a Theory for Explaining the Ontology of IT  Leadership:</h3>
  <p>The  sources of information for this study are literature, face to-face interviews,  and written artifacts of the institution. Naturally, researchers use these  sources to identify and explore the various characteristics of a successful IT  Leadership. Cooper and Schindler (2006) identified measurement as a method of  identifying events that can be assigned symbols to allow the researcher to  understand the event and making predictions. <br>
    The  selection process of the sample population focused on the investigation of the  current environment (Feng et al., 2014). The researcher selected the target  population from six Jordanian Universities. Interviewees consisted of IT  Managers, IT faculty members, and staff members for a total of 30 interviewees.  They were selected according to their experience and knowledge of the  organizational mission or purpose (Miles and Huberman, 1994). <br>
    Each  participant signed a consent to act as a research subject. Indeed, the consent  form is included in Appendix- A. The respondents Identity were concealed to  eliminate confounding factors. In addition, the interview questions were sent  to each participant prior to the interview date to facilitate and manage the  interview process.</p>
  <h3>Stage  3, Generate a Theory to Explain the Ontology of IT Leadership:</h3>
  <p>This  stage is divided into three sub-stages:</p>
  <h4>Basic  Analysis: continues analysis and data gathering until the research topic is  understood.</h4>
  <h4>Memoing:  recording important data including the researcher notes and analysis.</h4>
  <h4>Developing  Category Systems: divide the data into meaningful units, find associations  between them, and generate the final categories, which are shown in figure 2.</h4>
  <h3>Stage  4, Test the Theory Using a Quantitative Method:</h3>
  <p>After  forming the theoretical model, the research went to verify the theoretical  model, which is presented in figure 2. To test the hypotheses, the researcher  conducted an electronic questionnaire, which is useful when contacting with  groups of people in various locations, or those who might fear engaging in  face-to-face questionnaires (Trujillo, 2009). A sample of the online form is  included in Appendix-B.&nbsp; An assessment of  the identified factors in the conceptual models was included in the questionnaire,  which is based on Linkert scale (1 to 4). The coefficient cronbach's (alpha)  was used to assess the reliability of the questionnaire.</p>
  <h1>Results  and Analyses </h1>
  <p>This  section contains the results of the third and fourth stage in the methodology.  These results are as follows: </p>

    &nbsp;a Framework for explaining the ontology of  Successful IS Leadership. </p>
</div>
<br clear="all">
<div>
  <p>Obviously,  IT leadership requires focusing resources according to these principles. The  next section tests this framework.</p>
  <h3>Stage  4 Results, Testing the Theory Using a Quantitative Method:</h3>
  <p>To test  the framework identified in figure 2, it is important to note that the  researcher formed twenty questions to measure IT division success or failure.  These questions are based on the theoretical framework in figure 2. The  research sample contained 900 IT employees in various sectors and in different  levels that existed in 55 organizations. Accordingly, 480 questionnaires were  returned completed while 44% of participants where from academic sector and 56%  from business sector. The results show that 18 IT divisions were classified to  be successful in delivering IT services while 29 were classified as failing.<br>
    At the  same time, eight were classified as &ldquo;in conclusive&rdquo; and excluded from the  classification. The results in table one and two lead the research to infer the  following:</p>

  <p>In  accordance with the theoretical framework, table one shows that successful IT  organizations have high rate of Strategic Alignment, IT Change Management,  Innovation Management, and Internal Harmonization. On the other hand, table two  shows that failing IT organizations suffer from a significant drop of the same  rates. <br>
    Examining  Strategic Alignment values in both tables, the values show that the level of  strategic alignment always correlates with the level of organizational success  in both academic and business sectors. Indeed, research literature shows that  innovating in contrary to the business strategy causes failure to IT divisions  (Suh et al., 2013; Chiang and Nunez 2013).&nbsp;  Hence, this result highlights the decisive rule of aligning IT strategy  with organizational strategy. Accordingly, figure 3 represents a modification  to the framework identified in figure 2. Indeed, this modification reflects the  emphasis on the impact of strategic alignment in IT leadership.<br>
    Table  one show that the level of strategic alignment in business sector is relatively  higher than academic sector. To illustrate, research approves that high  competition requires high level of strategic alignment. Accordingly, academic  environment are exposed to less competition comparing to business environment. <br>
    IT  change management (for business organizations) is higher in both tables;  indeed, in dynamic business environment, there is always a need to make quick  changes to strategy; and consequently, restructure the organisation.&nbsp; <br>
    Table  two shows that failing organizations have an acceptable level of IT Change  Management and Innovation Management. However, this is not enough to compete  and survive in business environment. Especially, with the absence of proper  alignment between IT strategy and organizational strategy.</p>
  <h1>Conclusions</h1>
  <p>In this  research paper, the researcher explored the ontology of leadership in IT  organizations. Naturally, the research on strategic leadership is still under  exploration. A theoretical model of important characteristics of successful IT  leadership was developed and tested using data from different organizations.  Accordingly, the research concluded with the following:<br>
    &nbsp; Strategic Alignment is the cornerstone of  successful IT leadership.<br>
    Competition in business environment is more  fierce and intense comparing to competition  in academic environment.<br>
    Results show that nonalignment between IT strategy and organizational  strategy causes unnecessary waste of resources.<br>
    <img width="586" height="378" src="1_Developing_a_Framework_for_Exploring_the_Ontology_of_Information_Technology_Vol_III_Issue_VI_image006.gif"><br clear="ALL">
    Successful IT leadership does  not require having phenomenal characteristics. Conversely, it requires focusing  resources toward the characteristics identified in figure 3.<br>
    The  area of IT leadership requires further research toward developing a holistic  understanding of the ontological aspects of IT leadership.&nbsp; </p>
