  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Education  is always been the building block of the society, which helps in the  development and transformation of the society in accordance to the changes  taking place around it. Education can be defined as a concept of broadening the  horizon of an individual to improve his critical mental ability of  comprehending and aptitude building, over a longer time frame. The process of  education and learning continues the entire life of an individual changing its  form from being told &amp; imitation to trial &amp; error and thinking. During  the entire process of learning thought out our life one thing that remains  constant is our habit of learning to learn for enabling us to meet the changes  taking place around us.<br>
    In  India, it is quite difficult to trace the origin of education, because even as  in our ritual books it has been told that the future leaders of society have to  undergo a strict pattern of education known as Gurukul Parampara (Mentorship  system). Pulla Rao, D (2009) says that &ldquo;Education germinated in the Indian Soil  right from the beginning of its history. The Vedic schools were teachers based  schools. The disciples, soon after completing the education in Vedic school,  (Ashram) because teachers themselves in their own native place and started  ashram schools. Thus, the entire country was networked with the establishment  of Ashram Schools&rdquo;. In Gurukul system the Shishya (the disciple) of the Guru  (the teacher) have to stay with him at his place and to learn under his  mentorship. During this process the teacher shares experience and learning of  his life with him, inculcate in him the basic principles of life. This helps  the disciple to broaden his knowledge, which will guide him in his entire life  in all his decision making processes. Now at present, during this longer pace  of development of society and its values, the education system has also evolved  itself a lot to meet the changing dimensions of the society and its expectation  from the educational institution.<br>
    Today  learning has changed its phase and has transformed from Ashram Schools to case  studies and role playing methods. The thing that remains constant is the zeal  of continuous learning among the learners. Education being the long time  horizon concept helps in developing the critical reasoning ability of an  individual for their overall development and improved living style. Later on  various studies has shown that accompanying to education we required an  external intervention in the present skill set of the learner so that we can  work upon the skill obsolescence of the learners and keep them updated, while  meeting their on-the-job and off-the-job expectations. That is how this  external intervention is evolved as a separate discipline of study as Training  and Development. Where training is related to the training the trainee for  present skill enhance and improved performance; development is defined as his  future grooming for improved decision making ability and higher off-the-job  satisfaction. <br>
    A  simple training process is comprises of following four overlapped stages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analysis of Organizational Training Need (AOTN).</li>
    <li>Design and Development Phase.</li>
    <li>Implementation.</li>
    <li>Evaluation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AOTN  is the process of analysis of organizational training need which mean to do an  external and internal validation of the training objective and prioritize the  need generated so that the areas, in which training can be the best solution,  will be segregated for the problem in which training cannot. During design and  implementation phase we design the training programme and implement it and then  an evaluation is carried out to measure the effectiveness of the training  conducted.<br>
    Similar  to any other organization, education sector is also comprises of Human Resource  which are its teachers and administrative staff. And like any other output of  an organization education sector is also delivering output in terms of its  students, who will in future serve the society at different levels. For an  optimum production of output of an organization, the entire input variables are  required to be optimized, so as required in education sector also. Apart from  the physical facilities in Professional Education course, the most important  input variable which is required to be optimized is its faculty members, and  this is the reason why the study is undertaken to evaluate the benchmark  practices of training and development of professional education educators.</p>
  <h1>Scope of Research</h1>
  <p>Education  and educational institutions has always played an important role in the  development of the society and meeting the pace of that development. In the  present scenario also the educational institutions are making their  contribution at their full strength for the transformation and development of  the society. For any nation the most important asset to it, is its human  resource. Because human resource is the only asset which can appreciates with  time if provided with the proper input. And in a country like India which is a labor  surplus country, human resource is proving as an important input factor for the  development of the Nation. The system of education in India has evolved a lot  during the last century, but the factor which remains the same is the process  of value addition that is done by the teacher in their students of higher  professional education (students of under-graduation, graduation and  post-graduation level of professional courses), those students who will be the  leaders of tomorrow. The students, considering them as an output/end product of  the educational institutions, will serve the society at different hierarchical  level based on their intellectual capabilities. <br>
    In  the present scenario of Global Competition national boundaries no longer can  restrict the competitive force (Kumar Singh, Anup 2010). The present context of  Liberalization, Privatization and Globalization has depicted the importance of  interdependency and competitiveness of different nations for the better  utilization of the available resource. This has also reflected in the field of  education, resulting in losing the strength of the student&rsquo;s employability in  industry (the recruiters of the professional course students). A large number  of senior secondary graduates are opting for higher education specifically  higher professional education with the hope that it will add value to their  personal and professional life. This has generated a need to create a competitive  environment for the development of the students for increasing their competency  and their development, resulting in the study of the changing role of a  teacher. Good leaders are dedicated teachers. They spend a good time and energy  in developing their subordinates (Singh, 1999; Singh &amp; Pethe, 2003).  Teacher enlightens the path of success for the students and guides them like a  mentor for accomplishment of their career objective.  If students are considered as an end product  of education system, than the teacher (the faculty of the professional course  students) is one among the input variables which can alter the quality of that  output. The last century has shown the changing requirement of the society from  the younger generation, in term of intellectual and behavioral skills,  resulting in bringing the necessary changes in training and development  practices for the teacher so that they can perform the attitude building  exercise of the students more effectively while meeting the changing  requirements. <br>
    Over  the time it has been found that (Rajasingh, S., Rajasekaran, B. 2009), &lsquo;there  was a wide gap between the perception of industry and faculty on criteria for  quality of students especially on Generic Skills and Academic preparedness. The  Gap was even wider on the criteria for quality of faculty especially on  presentation skills of the faculty. The perception gap between industry and  faculty must be bridged to improve the employability of students and enhance  the quality of higher education&rsquo;. <br>
    This  necessitates a need to evolve or to give prime focus of the faculty training  &amp; development and educational activities. B.O.Smith (1969) provides a  meaning of Teacher-Education, &ldquo; one of the chief difference between a teacher  who is theoretically trained and one who is not, is that the theoretically  trained teachers will perform with a set sophisticated concepts taken from the  underlying disciplines of pedagogy as well as from the pedagogical field  itself. The teacher who is not theoretically trained will interpret events and  objects in terms of common sense concepts that have come from the experience of  the race permeated with outmode ideas about human behavior&rdquo;. <br>
    Punia  and Kundu (2005) suggested various sources of quality in management education.  Faculty orientation, training and development are one of them. They examined  the importance and availability of various faculty attribute apart from  technical attributes they have.  They  also recommended that the faculty development should an important priority of  higher professional education institutions. <br>
    The  objective of the researcher is to evaluate the benchmark practices of training  and development of professional education educators in India: a proposal with  respect to aspirant, so that they can increase their competency domain in the  right direction. Competency domain can be defined as a composition of  knowledge, skills and attitude that any individual holds. Measurement of its  effectiveness can be done by analyzing the present system of Analysis of  Training Need, if any. (Truelove, S. 2000) Analysis of Training Need is the  process of taking an overview of the performance of the  organization/individual. Its purpose is to identify where training can make  major contribution to the improvement of organizational performance. The need  of proper analysis of training need is because if the training need is not in  synchronization with the problem identified then the whole effort for training  will be diluted. This can be better understood with an example: If a teacher of  an engineering stream, even after his continuous efforts, is unable to generate  interest of his students in a subject of management stream which is to be  taught as a part course-curriculum, and identifies for himself that perhaps his  knowledge of subject at present is not sufficient for him to make the students  listen and follow him. Might be possible that the need identified by the  teacher to the effect of lack of interest is correct, but after conducting an  analysis of training need we will come to a conclusion that boredom in the  subject is just an effect and we still have to work upon the cause of this  effect so that based upon which the appropriate training programme can be  identified. Lack of subject knowledge of the teacher is a relevant cause but it  can also be possible that boredom is because of the teaching style or the  communication skill etc. <br>
    This  leads to us conclude that the need of the hour is to evaluate the present  benchmark practices of training and development of professional education educators  and to find out the whether there is a requirement of proper system of analysis  of training need for the faculty of professional education educators for  conducting their training and development activities more effectively and  efficiently.</p>
  <h1>Review of Literature</h1>
  <p>Anderson,  A.H. 2000 defines training as, &ldquo;..the systematic development of the attitude,  knowledge and skill behavior pattern by an individual in order to perform  adequately a given task or job. (Department of Employment, Glossary of Training  Terms)&rdquo;. Training is the process of changing the behaviour of any individual  for his future development. Anderson, A.H. 2000, training emphasis gives a  hierarchical representation of training outcome as: <br>
    i.  Simple motor skill, which demand little knowledge ex. Stamping document. <br>
    ii.  More complex skill, which requires some knowledge base. <br>
    iii.  Even more complex skills, which requires non-procedural skills. <br>
    iv.  Ability to merge knowledge and skills. <br>
    v.  Ability to integrate attitude, knowledge and skills, to create interpersonal  skills. <br>
    The  traditional approach of Training defines it as a process of four segregated  stages starting from:<br>
    i.        Training needs analysis.<br>
    ii.       Design/development phase.<br>
    iii.      Implementation phase.<br>
    iv.     Evaluation of the training outcome.<br>
    Training  need analysis is the process of locating the problem and identifying the need  of training followed by second stage of design and development phase which  deals with the design of a training programme based on the need identified in  the previous stage, step three of implementation phase is simply the  implementation of the designed training programme and last stage of evaluation  deals with the evaluation of the training outcome to measure the effectiveness  of the training programme. Over the time it has observed that they are not four  independent stages, in actual practice they overlap each other, as the outcome  of the last stage i.e. evaluation stage, which was done earlier, will serve as  a base for knowing the present status of competency and to forecast the  required level of competency for the changing job complexities. It has been  observed that the first stage i.e. analysis of training need is the most  important stage of training process. Analysis of training need helps in  identifying that what are the problematic areas or to identify the gap between  the present competency and required competency. It helps in defining the  problem and to differentiate between cause and effect of the problem. It is  very important to differentiate cause and effect of the problem, because it  might be possible that if the effect is misjudged as a cause and the training  need is identified while considering it, than there are some chances that the  training programme will result into nothing. Also Analysis of training need helps  into identifying and ensuring that the problem which has been identified, can  training be the best solution for it, or otherwise it will have some other  solution to it. If training cannot contribute for its solution then the problem  is communicated to the concerned department. <br>
    The  process of analysis of organizational training need is comprises of following  steps (Truelove, S. 2000):<br>
    i.        Appointment of a responsible person or a  team.<br>
    ii.       Plan the Analysis of organizational  training need activity.<br>
    iii.      Collect and analyze information to  identify issues and performance problems.<br>
    iv.     Further investigate to separate cause from  effect.<br>
    v.      Generate and evaluate solution matching to  cause.<br>
    vi.     Report the results.<br>
    vii.    Implement proposal.<br>
    viii.   Review, modify, revise proposal, if required.<br>
    Apart  from analysis of training need, the fourth stage training outcome evaluation is  very important to study, as it reflects the result achieved by the training  process. At time people believe that implementation, evaluation and feedback  are three completely distinct stages having one way contact with each other.  The author in personal opinion believes that even they are different, they  complement each other and as well they are two directional in nature. During  the implementation phase, the designed training programme is implemented, but  it is not done in isolation. The process of evaluation is continuously working  during the implementation phase also and keeping a record of the deviation of  actual from desired providing a continuous feedback to the system so that any  deviation will be rectified as early as possible so that the losses can be  minimized. <br>
    Kirkpatrick  (1976) put forward a conceptual framework suggesting four levels of criteria  for evaluating training outcome: <br>
    1)   Reaction Evaluation: The participant  suggestions for the trainer, duration, material etc. are observed. <br>
    2)  Learning Evaluation: Skills, knowledge and  attitude learned during the program. <br>
    3)  Behavior Evaluation: Change in the on-the-job  behavior performance. <br>
    4)  Result Evaluation: The ultimate change in the  performance of the organization like cost saving etc.<br>
    Similarly,  War, Bird and Rackham (1970) have also suggested a different approach for  evaluation, using the first four letters of the different levels it is the  acronym called CIRO: <br>
    1)  Context Evaluation: What need to be changed? <br>
    2)  Input Evaluation: What procedures are most  likely to bring about change? <br>
    3)  Reaction Evaluation: What are the trainees&rsquo;  opinions of the training? It is the least useful, easiest and most frequently  used method for evaluation. It provides help based on the idea that training  should be a self correcting system. If also serves a mode of feedback.  Reactions are generally collected by questionnaire. <br>
    4)  Outcome Evaluation: Proof of change in  behaviour? It is the longest time horizon evaluation process. This primarily  focuses on measuring the long term benefit of training. It also helps in  identifying the extent to which training is able to achieve its objective.  Outcome evaluation is conducted in three phases which are: <br>
    a)  Immediate: These are results based on the immediate output, that what are the  changes in KSA have resulted? Here the concern is related to the measure of the  effect caused by training in KSA. <br>
    b)  Intermediate: It is the measure of change in job performance because of  training. But it became difficult to separate the effect of training from other  causes. It can be done by: <br>
    »  Direct Measure: By measuring the performance in quantitative value. <br>
    »  Indirect Measure: By assigning a numeric value to subjective judgment of  performance. This can be done by using performance grid technique. This can be  done by asking a judge to rate individual on the dimension of motivation and  skills. Rating from low to high. <br>
    c)  Ultimate: It is the ultimate effect which has been caused to the organization  by training. Its main focus will be on the cost effectiveness of the training.  It can be done by <br>
    »  Cost effective analysis: Examination of training on the basis of monetary terms. <br>
    »  Cost benefit analysis: Examination of training on the basis of non-monetary  terms. Done by: <br>
    Human  resource value (HRV): The performance rating is converted to a cash value by  multiplying it by the personnel cost. This helps to calculate the HRV before  the training. And after the training personnel cost is multiplied by new  performance rating to calculate new HRV. And its difference indicates us about  the effectiveness of the training to organization.<br>
    (Kumar  Singh, Anup 2010), A faculty member during his entire career, serve different  roles to the institution, as during initial phase of his career his prime focus  is on teaching improvement and research work, in the middle time period he  contribute as management improvement and consulting and during the most senior  period of his life he contributes as an academic developer and institution  building role player. We know, in present era there is a presence of global  competition and complementariness, which is bring all the worldwide resources  together and utilizing them optimally. This increase in competition is  resulting into the higher level of expectations of the end users or society  from the goods and service industry, so do is for every field. And our  education sector also not remained untouched from this competition. The  students which are passing out every year from the universities have to face an  international competition from worldwide industries. This has increased the  opportunity available for them but at the same it has taken the completion into  global level where they have to compete with the students of foreign  universities. This increasing competition is now reflecting in the  employability of these students and hence reduced the number of employment. The  employability of the students has become a dependent variable of quality of the  students produced by any higher professional educational institution. Quality  can be understood as the presence of attributes in any end product which are  desired by its end users. It is very necessary for any product to be a quality  product that, it must hold all the specifications as  desired/required/forecasted/predicted.<br>
    Diana  Green (1991) defined the Quality of Higher Education as &ldquo;Producing Graduates to  meet the Human Resource needs of an Organization in the Business, Industrial  and Service Sector&rdquo;. Quality in education is referred to as the inculcating a  set of knowledge, attitude and skill behavioral pattern in the students, by  their undergoing through the course curriculum, so that they can successfully  meet the requirement/expectations of the society at various stages. Many  researchers has pointed out that the expectations of the different members of  the society are different, from the students. Based on their own (members of  the society) perception and requirements the criteria for quality in higher  education has various dimensions as according to the society (Peoples),  Management of the institution, Faculty, Recruiters and very differently but  obvious for students. The public wants the students to be graduate with general  abilities and emphasizes criteria such as communication skills (Cave &amp;  Hanney, 1992). Faculty view the primary obligation of the university to the  student to be the development of intellectual independence (Baird, 1988), and  hence focus on criteria&rsquo;s such as ability to think critically (Barnett, 1988;  Trice &amp; Dey 1997).   Apart from all  these expectations, students have a very different concern of their careers;  they value criteria such as the ability to get a job (Dey, Astin, &amp; Korn,  1991). Above all the management of the institution wants to show that the input  factors, which it is providing for the students development, are capable and  being used very potentially, for them, student completion of programme  requirement is an important criteria (Nandeau, Donald, &amp; Konrad, 1992).  (Rajasingh, S., Rajasekaran, B. 2009), &ldquo;To date, perception of the major  stakeholder &ldquo;industry&rdquo; on the quality criteria of students (output) and the  faculty (input) is ignored and left unaddressed. Hence we sought to determine  the perception of faculty and industry on the criteria for both the quality of  students and faculty. The perception gap between the academic leaders and  industry leaders is sought to be identified on criteria/factors for quality of  student&rsquo;s such as communication skills, academic performance, generic skills,  learning skills, social responsibility, employment competence and academic  preparedness&rdquo;. Thus the above argument leads us to conclude that there is a  difference in expectation from a student by a faculty and recruiter, which  leads to the confusion in students for his identifying the right path for his  excellence. Where student is the end product and teacher is one among the input  variable used in the transformation process of the student, it became necessary  for the teacher to keep himself updated, as according to the requirements at  times. The above problem can be solved by bridging this gap between the  expectation of faculty and the expectation of recruiter. This leads a faculty  member to continuously undergo faculty development programme on continuous  basis.<br>
    Pulla  Rao, D (2009), Training for teachers in higher education is relatively a new  phenomenon. In pursuance of the proposal of the NPE-1986, the government of  India has established 48 academic staff colleges, which impart in-service  training to the teachers of higher education. At, present 51 of such academic  staff colleges are functioning. These institutions are fully financed by UGC  and are supposed conduct orientation course for newly recruited teachers and  refresher courses for existing ones. The academic staff college of Uttarakhand  is in Kumaun University Nainital. Here we are not much concerned about where  the training is conducted, but the point of concern is how a training need has been  identified for any teacher and how it is so sure that the training need which  has been identified is the appropriate solution to the problem faced. Is there  a specific method for training need analysis of it has been identified by the  trainee at random.<br>
    Training  can be defined as an instructor led content based intervention used to  systematically develop the attitude, knowledge and skill behavior pattern of an  individual, so that he can perform a repetitive task more efficiently and  effectively. Development, under the traditional vision falls in the middle  between training and education. Development can cover the present role or some  grooming for the future greatness (Anderson, A.H. 2000). Need for training and  development arises in any area because of the changing nature and the  complexities of jobs. It helps in reducing the obsolescence of skill and always  helps the trainee to update his competency domain. Gaff (1975), in his seminal  work, pointed out that an educational institution can get high return on  investment in faculty in terms of productivity, creativity, morale,  satisfaction and renewal of faculty. Mishra (2002) opined that no educational  system can exist without competent faculty. An effective teacher not only  imparts education but he should also inspire his student. Faculty development  programmes/training and development activities for faculties in higher  professional educational institutions are always been an important role player  for the development of faculties. In the field of management education Punia  and Kundu (2005) suggested various sources of quality in management education.  Faculty orientation and development is one of them. They examined the  importance and applicability of various faculties attributes such as,  communication, subject knowledge, commitment, encouragement for class  participation, accessibility of teachers in and out of class etc. They found  that there is a wide gap between the importance of all these attributes and  there applicability in both government and private organization. Today in the  field of professional education, where global competition is increasing, it has  become very important for a good teacher to be a good learner. Access to  knowledge is increased with the usage of internet and e-books, as a result of which  the competency domain of a faculty obsolete very fast. That is why it became  necessary for him to undergo continues training and development programme. This  too also happens with the faculty who are scared of adopting new technology in  their style of teaching, as Kean (1992) pointed out that many faculty are  confused and threatened by communication technologies, as a result, their  teaching suffers. The need for faculty training and development is developing  concern to identify the attributes which are the part of the competency domain  of a teacher to serve his duties efficiently. <br>
    Sometimes  there remains a gap between the present competency domain and the required  competency from a trainee, which is called as training gap. This training gap  is identified by analyzing the training need. Analysis of training need is the  process of taking an overview of the performance of an individual. It is the  process of analyzing the present status of an individual/organization based on  some pre defined attributes, judging his present performances and drawing  conclusions based on those attributes. For a teacher, as said above, it is very  necessary to keep him updated and for doing so he continuously has to identify  the training gap. Actual problem arises, when a teacher at random, identifies  or selected for him any training programme without undergoing a proper analysis  of training need. Here the point of concern is to check whether the present  method, if any, is working appropriately and it not then how can it be improvised.</p>
  <h1>Proposed Objectives of Study</h1>
  <p>Among  all the stages of training, Analysis of Organizational Training Need (AOTN), is  the most important and time taking process which is required to be done to make  any training programme effective. The study &lsquo;Evaluation of Benchmark Practices  of Training and Development of Professional Education Educator in India- A proposal  with respect to aspirants&rsquo;, is limited to the first stage of training programme  that whether there is proper method of AOTN for Professional Education  Educators which is followed. For doing so the following sub-objectives are  formulated<br>
    1)      To identify the different benchmark  practices of training and development of professional education educator  followed in India.<br>
    2)      To measure Attitude of trainees (trainees  are the teachers undergone any training programme) toward Training and  Development Benchmark Practices.<br>
    3)      To measure the effectiveness of present  Benchmark Practices of Training and Development of Professional Education  Educators followed in India. </p>
  <h1>Hypotheses</h1>
  <p>Following  are the hypothesis development for the achievement of above said objectives:<br>
    1.1.   Null Hypothesis (H0): There are no  significant benchmark practices of training and development of professional  education educators that are followed in India.<br>
    1.2.   Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no  significance relationship between awareness about benchmark practices and the  training programme attended.<br>
    1.3.   Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant  relationship between benchmark practices and their expansion of competency  domain. <br>
    During  the course of study if any new hypotheses are emerged, they will also be  included.</p>
  <h1>Research Methodology</h1>
  <p>Research  Methodology is a guideline system to scientifically solve a research problem,  with specific components such as methods, techniques and tools. It can be  defined also as the analysis of the principles of methods, rules, and  postulates employed by a discipline. It is therefore a prerequisite for a  researcher to design the research methodology for their problem since it may  differ from problem to problem. The research methodology used here is  descriptive in nature. The research methodology undertaken includes: <br>
    1.      Population: The study is concerned with  the &lsquo;Evaluation of Benchmark Practices of Training and Development Practices of  Professional Education Educators in India- A proposal with respect to Aspirants  &rsquo;, and hence the population will be the Professional Education Educator India  who are aspiring for various training programmes, which means that the Faculty  Members of Professional Courses delivering their contribution of inculcating  various skills in students, which will help them in their various stages of  life. The population for the study undertaken will be the Educators of  Management Education because the benchmark practices that have been setup are  distinctive for different Professional Education Educators depending upon the  nature of the course we are considering.  <br>
    2.      Sample Size: Based upon Yamane (1967:886)  formulae for a population more than 1.00.000, at 95 % confidence, ±5 %  precision and a proportion of 0.5 indicating maximum variability in population,  the number of respondents for the study will not be less than 400. Sampling  technique which can be used is snowball sampling as the research is primarily  targets upon professional educator educators who are undergoing any training or  development activity will be more effectively accessible using reference group  of the first level respondent who are directly known to the researcher.<br>
    3.      Method for data collection: The data is to  be collected via primary and secondary sources. Method which will be considered  is interviewing method. Interviewing method can used, in the form of in-depth  interviews and/or telephonic interviews, depending upon the constraint of  research. Also expert&rsquo;s opinion would seek to attain an in-depth insight of  different benchmark practices and their impact.  <br>
    4.      Analysis of Data: Analysis of data is done  by measuring attitudinal responses of the population. Attitudinal responses will  be analyzed using various statistical tools and available software which are  relevant with the study.</p>
  <h1>Limitations of the Study</h1>
  <p>There  are some problems which might be faced by the researcher during the research  work as:<br>
    i.        Because the proposed research work is  new in this field, hence it has a shortage of review of literature and  secondary data sources.<br>
    ii.       Because of the shortage of review of  literature and secondary data resources this research work is more inclined  toward exploratory and qualitative research.<br>
    iii.      Problem of proper selection of ideal  sample size due to time constraint of research work, lack of previous data  availability and financial constraint.<br>
    iv.     Because of a large size of population for  study in India, there is a problem of proper representation of sample of entire  population.<br>
    v.      Problems in data collection due to  diversified sector in economy.</p>
