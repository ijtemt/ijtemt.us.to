<p><em>Abstract</em>— <strong>As an organization develops  plans and strategies to deal with threats and opportunities present in its  environment, it should consider issues related to: developing that is capable  of producing the services and goods in the demanded quantities, planning how to  use the system effectively, and managing key elements of the operations of  carbon emission. Each of these topics is described briefly in the following</strong>.<br>
  Keywords-  Manufacture; Carbon Emission; Decision Making;  Development; Improvement; Customers </p>
<h1> Introduction</h1>
<p>Do  you drive a car, write checks, have a savings account, or get medical  treatment? If so, already you have been affected by operations and operations  management. This is the Operations processes manufacture that transform inputs  of Carbon Emission (labor, capital, materials, and energy) into outputs  (services and goods) final customers will acquire those final products. The  Services points are intangible products, and providing goods target are  physical products. According to the step classification used by the United State Department of Commerce and  Department of Labor and services (utilities, entertainment, transportation,  education, communications), and other multiple services on this manufacture  operation. Goods are described as articles of trade, merchandise, or wares.  Manufacturing is a specific issue referring to the main production.<br>
  Every operation employ, most to  build facilities, and purchase equipment with an objective to provide  intangible services, such in different sector of the economic in order to be  finished and get satisfaction from customers. Well on manufacture can see the  process to be engaging transformation products and services. The operating  objective of manufacture and enterprises are making production &amp; final  products to have billions of banking transactions, thousands of fire runs, each  day-year, and they do so very efficiently.<br>
  The working targets in operations  are focus to maximize greater output than they would be working, because  manufactures [20] have been developed on sophisticated facilities and equipment  that easily could increase worker productivity. Enterprises also provide internal  condition to their employ as: training<strong> </strong>in order to have strong workforces,  in this way can raise their knowledge on the manufacture area, and also improve  their capabilities. As a result of these productivity improvements and training  enrichments, more outputs are produced and the standard of living increases for  everyone. <br>
  Operations  and production management have the same meaning as multidiscipline field that  focuses on managing an enterprises operation. We can notice that, scope of  operations management includes decision making about the design, planning, and management of the several factors that  can affect manufacture operations, according to the pollution of Carbon  Emission, [20]. Decisions include: what products to produce, how large a  facility to build, where to locate the facility with respect to customers and  suppliers, what methods to use to enrich product quality, how many quantity to  produce next month, how employees should be trained, how many employ need on  the manufacture, what techniques and equipment to use. Operations managers most  to apply ideas and technologies to increase productivity and reduce costs, in order to be competitive on internal  or external market, [17] improving flexibility to meet rapidly changing  customer satisfaction, shorten delivery time, enhance product quality, and  improve customer service which, was commented by [19].</p>

<h1>Literature Review And Manufactureing Strategic</h1>
<p>There  has been a rich body of literature on the management and operations of global  supply chain networks, [18] that consist of markets and manufacturing  facilities [20] in several countries with different  strategic operation platform environments, to joint international markets.  Readers are referred to some recent survey papers, such as [2]; [1]; [5],  and [14], for comprehensive reviews of various issues addressed in the  literature pertaining to the management network of global supply chains as  mention by [19], and according to maximize overseas market  performance. Readers also can find from [13], a summary of research  methodologies used to implement strategic plans on global supply chains. One of  the main strategic of the literature in recent years has been the development  of operational and international market strategies, to hedge against market  uncertainty and internal market [18] at international market risks,  such as integral development at the market behavior. In particular; [7], [2]; [10]; [8]; [6]; [12]; [9]; [3],  and [4], those researchers use  mathematical programming and other quantitative models, to qualify a study and  effectiveness of management network flexibility (as manufacturing location,  inventory replenishment, allocation of production, platform implementing, etc.)  at overseas market, which are uncertainties. Although some of these models  include after logistics a profit maximization as their objectives (see [14])  for a list of supply chain papers with logistics profit maximization  objectives), the effects of logistics cost and tariffs as mentioned by [21] are  simply treated as parts of the variable costs of the products and financial  flows (for example, adding a percentage of a tariff to the cost of a product  imported into a country, or subtracting a percentage of the corporate extra  cost from the profit made in a country). Thus, the inclusion of international  logistics cost in these models typically does not change the structures of the  underlying optimization issue. Another source of literature, including [16]; [2]; [11]; [22]; [5]  and [15], considers using networking platform as commercial methods could improve  the performance of destination supply chain management. In these papers,  commercial networking platform, along with countries integration and  distribution platform decisions, become part of decisions that could take  advantage of differentiated of each countries logistics cost. </p>
<h1>Developing Methodologies</h1>
<p>Develop ideas on production making  is begins to produce product improve. Product development involves determining  the characteristics and features of a product. For example, Should a car be  equipped with side air bags? Product development begins with an assessment of  customer needs and includes a detailed product. The facilities and equipment  that will produce the service or good, as well as the information systems  needed to monitor and control performance, should be designed. Product  development is a cross-functional decision making process that requires  teamwork to make improve and different products for market and implement the  marketing, financial, and operating plans needed in order to join the market  successful. <br>
  Develop and improve product is a  critical activity because it determines the characteristics, features, and  functionality of the market need [17]. On the product development have to  evaluate cost and quality as well as its features and performance, and these  are important factors on which customers make purchasing decisions. Techniques  such as design for manufacturing and assembly are being implemented to improve  product quality and lower Carbon Emission costs by focusing on operating issues  during product design. This is critical even though improving to reduce costs  is a small part of the total cost of a product because develop may determine up  to 90 percent of the total production costs. For example, when police  departments develop a procedure for booking a suspect, the procedure dictates  the amount of time spent by the police officers, clerical staff, and management  each time a booking takes place. A procedure that wastes time and duplicates  effort will substantially affect the department's costs. </p>
Quality functional deployment (QFD) can be an  important 
<p>method for improving product because  it focuses developing efforts on customer needs. QFD is a set of planning and  communication that focuses attention on customer request and describes each  part of improving that affect these requests. QFD procedures provide a  framework for product development that enhances learning and coordinates  actions. <br>
  Development Process mentions how the  product will be made. The processes develop decision have two major components:  a technical or engineering component and a scale economy or business issue. The  technical component includes selecting equipment and sequences for production.  For example, a fast food restaurant should decide whether its hamburgers would  be flame-broiled or fried. Decisions are made about the sequence of operations.  For example, should a car rental agency immediately inspect a car that has been  returned by the customer, or first send it to be cleaned and washed by  maintenance? Most likely, the car should be inspected first so that damage that  might occur in the cleaning process would not be counted against the customer. <br>
  The scale economy or business  component involves applying the proper amount of mechanization (tools and  equipment) to make the organization's workforce more productive. This includes  determining: </p>
<ol>
  <li>If the demand for a  product is large and enough to justify mass production, such as a fast food  restaurant that purchases specialized equipment to make a large volume quickly; </li>
  <li>If there is sufficient  variety in customer demand so that flexible production systems are required,  such as a full-service restaurant that purchases general-purpose equipment to  produce its diverse menu; or </li>
  <li>If demand for a product  is so small that it cannot support a dedicated production facility. </li>
</ol>

  Figure 2. Process  life cycle, Authors diagram illustration<br>
  Mass customizations are a processes  alternative to mass-producing standardized products. Customers are demanding  both greater products with low price on goods and services as suggested by [21].  To enhance value to their customers, enterprises are searching for ways to  improve the apparently conflicting aim. Mass customization enables enterprises  to quickly develop, produce, and deliver a high volume of differentiated  products that meet specific customer needs at mass production prices. Mass  customization provides an impressive return on investments by producing products  for many small market segments on the same equipment and facilities.<br>
  Facility develop are involving on  the capacity, location, and layout for the facility. Capacity is a measure of  an organization's ability to provide the demanded services or goods in the  quantity requested by the customer and in a timely manner. Capacity planning  involves estimating demand, determining the capacity of facilities, and  deciding how to change the organization's capacity to respond to demand. <br>
  Facility  layout is the arrangement of the workspace within a facility. It considers  which departments or work areas should be adjacent to one another so that the  flow of product, information, and people can move quickly and efficiently  through the production.<br>

  Figure 3. Product  life cycle, Authors Diagram illustration </p>
<h1>Manufacture Planning Process</h1>
<p>On manufacturing planning may  describe how management expects to use the existing resource base that was  created during the process on production of Carbon Emission. One of the  outcomes of this planning process may be to change the system design to cope  with changes in the environment. For example, management may decide to increase  or decrease capacity to cope with changing demand, or rearrange layout to  enhance efficiency. <br>
  Decision making on plan production  depend on specific time. Long-range decisions could include the sequences  number of facilities required to meet customer needs, how facilities could be  altered to produce new products, or how technological change might affect the  methods used to produce services and goods. The specific time for long-term  planning varies with the sector and depends on how long it would take on the  enterprises to build new facilities or make major technological changes. For  example, in the aircraft industry it may take five to ten years to design a new  aircraft and build a facility to produce it. So management must plan at least  that far into the future. A car rental agency, on the other hand, would need a  much shorter time horizon for production planning because it can make changes  more quickly. </p>
In medium on range production planning, which is  normally about one year, manage find it difficult to make major changes in  facilities. At most, modest expansion may be achieved or some new equipment  installed. Here, production planning may include several points&rsquo; as: workforce  size, developing training programs, working with suppliers to improve product  quality and improve delivery, and determining 
<p>how much  material to order on an aggregate basis.<br>
  Capacity Growth Planning </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Operations  and operating strategies with the overall strategy of the organization  (including engineering, financial, marketing, and information system  strategies) synergy can result. Operations become a positive factor when  facilities, equipment, and employee was training are viewed as a means to  achieve organizational aim, rather than suboptimal departmental aim. The  criteria for judging operations is changing from cost control, which is a  narrowly defined operating objective, to more global performance measures such  as product [21], performance and variety, product quality, delivery time, and  customer service. When flexibility is designed into operations, an enterprise  is able to rapidly and inexpensively respond to changing customer needs.</p>
Manufacture operations should always be a value  added activity and reduce constantly carbon emission. This means that customers  should be willing to pay more for the finished product than the total costs of  the inputs. In the private industry, the difference between the price  consumer&rsquo;s pay and the cost of production is profit; profit can be reinvested  to build new and better products, thus creating wealth<strong> </strong>for society. In the public sector, the benefits  added by designing and producing a new product should always be greater than  the costs. This added value, once again, represents an increase in wealth for  society. For example, effective fire protection should reduce fire insurance  premiums, decrease the number of fires because of successful fire prevention  programs, and cut the losses from fires because of rapid response and better  fire-fighting techniques and equipment. Value added fire protection would have  more benefits to society than the sum of the costs of providing it. Training  firefighters, purchasing equipment, and selecting a new location for a fire  station, should all be undertaken with this value-added approach in mind? All  operating decisions, indeed all the decisions made by the organization, should  consider how customers or potential 
<p>customers  would value the outcome of the decision.</p>
