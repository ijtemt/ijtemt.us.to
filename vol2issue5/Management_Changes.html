Crisis management is that art of making decisions to head off or mitigate the effects of an incident that threatens to harm, or has harmed, your institution’s people, structures, ability to operate, valuables and/or reputation. This often means making decisions dynamically with situations as they unfold, often in unpredictable ways while you are under stress and you lack key pieces of information. For example; Evacuation after a called-in bomb threat, Denial of entry to suspicious persons etc. This paper will help illustrate the international management changes in crisis management and some appropriate Business Continuity to keep crisis far away from a company or institution.</p>

<p><strong><em>ABSTRACT</em></strong><strong>- Crisis management is  that art of making decisions to head off or mitigate the effects of an incident  that threatens to harm, or has harmed, your institution&rsquo;s people, structures,  ability to operate, valuables and/or reputation. This often means making  decisions dynamically with situations as they unfold, often in unpredictable  ways while you are under stress and you lack key pieces of information. For  example; Evacuation after a called-in bomb threat, Denial of entry to  suspicious persons etc. This paper will help illustrate the international  management changes in crisis management and some appropriate Business  Continuity to keep crisis far away from a company or institution. </strong><br>
  <strong><em>KEYWORDS-</em></strong><strong> crises management, types of crisis, crisis  leadership, successful &amp; unsuccessful initiatives of crisis management,  business continuity. </strong><br>
  I- PREFACE<br>
  Management  in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people  together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and  effectively. It comprises of planning, organizing, staffing, leading or  directing, and controlling an organization or effort for the purpose of  accomplishing a goal, according to Frenchman <em>Henri Fayol </em>(1841–1925). He was one of the most influential  contributors to modern concepts of management. Also, <em>Mary Parker Follett</em> (1868–1933), another thinker wrote &quot;the  art of getting things done through people&quot; in the early twentieth century.  She described management as a philosophy. Some people, found this definition  useful, but considered it far too narrow. Crisis  management therefore is that process by which an organization deals with  a major event that threatens to harm the organization, its stakeholders, or the  general public. Three elements are common to most definitions of crisis: (a) a  threat to the organization, (b) the element of surprise, and (c) a short  decision time. <em>Venette</em> argues that  &quot;crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer  be maintained.&quot;  Consequently, the  fourth defining quality is the need for a change. It is a discipline within the  broader context of management consisting of skills and techniques required to  identify, assess, understand, and cope with a serious situation, especially  from the moment it first occurs to the point that recovery procedures start.<br>
  Therefore,  Crisis management consists of: Methods used to respond to both the reality and  perception of crises; Establishing metrics to define what scenarios constitute  a crisis and should consequently trigger the necessary response mechanisms; Communication  that occurs within the response phase of emergency management scenarios. Crisis  management is occasionally referred to as incident management; although several  industry specialists such as <em>Peter Power</em> argue that the term crisis management is more accurate. The credibility and  reputation of organizations is heavily influenced by the perception of their  responses during crisis situations. The organization and communication involved  in responding to a crisis in a timely fashion makes for a challenge in  businesses. There must be open and consistent communication throughout the hierarchy  to contribute to a successful crisis communication process. Crisis is also a  facet of risk management, although it is probably untrue to say that Crisis  Management represents a failure of Management since it will never be possible  to totally mitigate the chances of catastrophes occurring.</p>
<p align="center">II- EMERGENCY  MANAGEMENT: TYPES OF CRISIS &amp; CRISIS LEADERSHIP<br>
  During  crisis management process, it is important to identify types of crises whereby  different crises necessitate strategies. Potential crises are enormous, but  crises can be clustered. <em>Lerbinger</em> categorized seven types of crises, while <em>Erika  Hayes James</em>, an organizational psychologist at the University of Virginia&rsquo;s  Darden Graduate School of Business, identifies two primary types of  organizational crisis. She defines organizational crisis of leadership as &ldquo;any  emotionally charged situation that, once it becomes public, invites negative  stakeholder reaction and thereby has the potential to threaten the financial  well-being, reputation, or survival of the firm or some portion thereof.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">A. TYPES OF CRISIS</p>
<p><em>1) </em><em>Natural crises</em><br>
  Typically  natural disasters are considered as acts of God, such as: earthquakes, volcanic  eruptions, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, landslides, tsunamis, storms and  droughts that threaten life, property, and the environment itself. For example,  the <em>Indian Ocean earthquake</em> on December 26th<em> 2004 </em>which was an undersea mega thrust earthquake that occurred with  an epicenter off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia; killing over 230,000  people in fourteen countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up  to 30m (100&nbsp;feet) high. </p>
<p><em>2) Technological crises</em><br>
  Caused by human application of  science and technology, Technological accidents inevitably occur when  technology becomes complex and something goes wrong in the whole system  (Technological breakdowns). Some technological crises occur when human error  causes disruptions (Human breakdowns). People therefore tend to assign blames  on others because technology is subject to human manipulation whereas they do  not hold anyone responsible for natural disaster. When an accident creates  significant environmental damage, the crisis is categorized as mega damage. For example software  failures, industrial accidents, and oil spills. Such maneuver will easily tear  up even the most firm company into pieces which become hard to pick up for  analysis.</p>
<p><em>3) Confrontation  crises</em><br>
  These  occur when discontented individuals and/or groups fight businesses, regime, and  various interest groups to win acceptance of their demands and expectations.  The common type of confrontation crises is boycotts, and other types are  picketing, sit-ins, ultimatums to those in authority, blockade/occupation of  buildings, and resisting or disobeying police (a political uprising). For example  the <em>Nike boycott</em> which was a form of consumer activism involving the  act of voluntarily abstaining from using, buying, or dealing with a person,  organization, or country as an expression of protest. If such a resistance  comes by your company, there will be no way of activities going on within the  institution and therefore will be an emergency crisis alarm.</p>
<p><em>4) Crises of  malevolence</em><br>
  This  occurs when opponents or miscreant individuals use criminal means or other  extreme tactics for the purpose of expressing hostility or anger toward, or  seeking gain from, a company, country, or economic system, perhaps with the aim  of destabilizing or destroying it. Sample crises include product tampering,  kidnapping, malicious rumors, terrorism, and espionage. We all know that  companies nowadays rival each other, so as to have the best customers or public  attention; unfortunately it&rsquo;s a race of all companies of the same services for  the same goal, which can end up in chaos.</p>
<p><em>5)    Crises of organizational misdeeds</em><br>
  Crises  occur when management takes actions it knows will harm or place stakeholders at  risk for harm without adequate precautions. <em>Lerbinger</em> specified three different types of crises of organizational misdeeds: crises of  skewed management values, crises of deception, and crises of management  misconduct. With this, there will be more tensions and no trust worthiness  amongst the staff, bringing them towards their downfall. </p>
<p><em>   a) Crises of skewed  management values</em><br>
  Crisis  caused when managers favor short-term economic gain and neglect broader social  values and stakeholders other than investors. This state of lopsided values is  rooted in the classical business creed that focuses on the interests of  stockholders and tends to view the interests of its other stakeholders (customers,  employees). For Example Sears sacrifices customer trust.</p>
<p><em>   b) Crises of  deception</em><br>
  This  is when management conceals or misrepresents information about itself and its  products in its dealing with consumers and others. For example the Dow Corning&rsquo;s  silicone-gel breast implant, which ended up in deception for less customers  after the class-action lawsuits which claimed that this breast implant caused a  systematic health failure such as cancer, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p><em>   c) Crises of  management misconduct</em> <br>
  Some  crises are deliberate amorality and illegality. For example <em>Martha Stewart&rsquo;s, </em>(who was an American  business magnate, media personality, author, and magazine publisher) fraud  case. In 2004, she was convicted of lying to investigators about a stock sale  and served five months in a West Virginia federal prison camp. Although the  media widely speculated that the situation would effectively be the end of her  media empire, Stewart began a comeback campaign in 2005, with her company  returning to profitability.</p>
<p><em>6) Rumors</em><br>
  False  information about an organization or its products creates crises hurting the  organization&rsquo;s reputation. An example is <em>Procter  &amp; Gamble's Logo controversy.</em> This company received unwanted media  publicity in the 1980s when rumors spread that the moon-and-stars logo was a  satanic symbol. The accusation was based on a particular passage in the Bible,  specifically <em>Revelation 12:1</em>, which  states: <em>&quot;And there appeared a great  wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and  upon her head a crown of 12 stars.&quot;</em> P&amp;G's logo consisted of a  man's face on the moon surrounded by 13 stars, and some claimed that the logo  was a mockery of the heavenly symbol alluded to in the aforementioned verse,  thus construing the logo to be satanic. <br>
  B.    CRISIS LEADERSHIP<br>
  <em>1)</em><em> Sudden crises</em><br>
  These  are circumstances that occur without warning and beyond an institution&rsquo;s  control. Consequently, sudden crises are most often situations for which the  institution and its leadership are not blamed.</p>
<p><em>2) Smoldering crises</em><br>
  This differ from sudden crises in  that they begin as minor internal issues that, due to manager&rsquo;s negligence,  develop to crisis status. These are situations when leaders are blamed for the  crisis and its subsequent effect on the institution in question. James categorizes five phases of crisis that require  specific crisis leadership competencies. Signal detection, Preparation and  prevention, Containment and damage control, Business recovery and Learning<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>a) Signal  detection</em><br>
  This  is the stage in a crisis in which leaders should (but do not constantly) sense  early warning signals, that suggest the possibility of a crisis. The detection  stages of a crisis include: Sense-making: represents an attempt to create order  and make sense, retrospectively, of what occurs. Perspective-taking: the  ability to consider another person's or group's point of view.</p>
<p><em>    b) Preparation and prevention</em><br>
  It is  during this stage that crisis handlers begin preparing for or averting the  crisis that had been foreshadowed in the signal detection stage. Wal-Mart has  been described as an emergency relief standard bearer after having witnessed  the incredibly speedy and well-coordinated effort to get supplies to the Gulf  Coast of the United States in anticipation of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p><em>    c) Containment and damage control</em><br>
  Usually,  the goal of crisis containment and damage control is to limit the reputational,  financial, safety, and other threats to firm survival. Crisis handlers work  diligently to bring the crisis to an end as quickly as possible to limit  negative publicity to the organization, and move into the business recovery  phase.</p>
<p><em>    d) Business recovery</em><br>
  When  crisis hits, organizations must be able to carry on with their business in the  midst of the crisis while simultaneously planning for how they will recover  from the damage caused. Crisis handlers not only must engage in continuity  planning (determining the people, financial, and technology resources needed to  keep the organization running), but will also actively pursue organizational  resilience.<br>
  <em>    e) Learning</em> <br>
  In  the wake of a crisis, organizational decision makers adopt a learning  orientation and use prior experience to develop new routines and behaviors that  ultimately change the way the organization operates. </p>
<p align="center">III- LITERATURE  REVIEW: MODELS &amp; THEORIES ASSOCIATED WITH CRISIS MANAGEMENT.<br>
  A lot  of people always see companies like semi-gods, thinking that they are  indestructible, their life span are eternal. Whereas, these companies do face  both internal and external challenges everyday; which are often hidden to the  public for a simple reason of future upgrade and business continuity.</p>
<p><em>A. Crisis  Management Model</em><br>
  Successfully  defusing a crisis requires an understanding of how to handle a crisis – before  they occur. <em>Gonzalez-Herrero</em> and <em>Pratt</em> found the different phases of  Crisis Management. There are 3 phases in any Crisis Management as below:<br>
  1.  The diagnosis of the impending trouble or the danger signals<br>
  2.  Choosing appropriate Turnaround Strategy<br>
  3.  Implementation of the change process and its monitoring.</p>
<p><em>B. Management  Crisis Planning</em><br>
  No  corporation looks forward to facing a situation that causes a significant  disruption to their business, especially one that stimulates extensive media  coverage. Public scrutiny can result in a negative financial, political, legal  and government impact. Therefore Crisis management planning deals with  providing the best response to a crisis.</p>
<p><em>C. Contingency  planning</em><br>
  Preparing  contingency plans in advance, as part of a crisis management plan, is the first  step to ensuring an organization is appropriately prepared for a crisis. Crisis  management teams can rehearse a crisis plan by developing a simulated scenario  to use as a drill. The plan should clearly stipulate that the only people to  speak publicly about the crisis are the designated persons, such as the company  spokesperson or crisis team members. The first hours after a crisis breaks are  the most crucial, so working with speed and efficiency is important, and the  plan should indicate how quickly each function should be performed. Providing  incorrect or manipulated information has a tendency to backfire and will  greatly exacerbate the situation. The contingency plan should contain  information and guidance that will help decision makers to consider not only  the short-term consequences, but the long-term effects of every decision.</p>
<p><em>D. Business  continuity planning</em><br>
  When  a crisis will undoubtedly cause a significant disruption to an organization, a  business continuity plan can help minimize the disruption. First, one must  identify the critical functions and processes that are necessary to keep the  organization running. Then each critical function/process must have its own  contingency plan in the event that one of them ceases or fails. Testing these  contingency plans by rehearsing the required actions in a simulation will allow  in the event of an actual crisis, for the team members act more quickly and  effectively.</p>
<p><em>E. Structural-functional  systems theory</em><br>
  This  systems theory addresses the intricacies of information networks and levels of  command making up organizational communication. This theory also identifies  information flow in organizations as &quot;networks&quot; made up of members  and &quot;links&quot;. Information in organizations flow in patterns called  networks.</p>
<p><em>F. Diffusion of  innovation theory</em><br>
  Developed  by <em>Everett Rogers</em>, this theory  describes how innovation is disseminated and communicated through certain  channels over a period of time. Diffusion of innovation in communication occurs  when an individual communicates a new idea to one or several others. At its  most elementary form, the process involves: (1) an innovation, (2) an  individual or other unit of adoption that has knowledge of or experience with  using the innovation, (3) another individual or other unit that does not yet  have knowledge of the innovation, and (4) a communication channel connecting  the two units.<br>
  <br>
  <em>G. Role of  apologies in crisis management</em><br>
  There  has been debate about this crisis management, and some argue that apology opens  an organization up for possible legal consequences. &quot;However some evidence  indicates that compensation and sympathy are as effective as an apology in  shaping people&rsquo;s perceptions of the organization taking responsibility for the  crisis because these strategies focus on the victims&rsquo; needs. The sympathy  response expresses concern for victims while compensation offers victims  something to offset the suffering.&quot;</p>
<p><em>H. Unequal human  capital theory</em><br>
  James postulates that  organizational crisis can result from discrimination lawsuits. James&rsquo;s theory of  unequal human capital and social position derives from economic theories of  human and social capital concluding that minority employees receive fewer  organizational rewards than those with access to executive management. In a  recent study of managers in a <em>Fortune</em> 500 company, race was found to be  a predictor of promotion opportunity or lack thereof. Thus, discrimination  lawsuits can invite negative stakeholder reaction, damage the company's  reputation, and threaten corporate survival.</p>
<p><em>I. Crisis leadership</em><br>
  There are six leadership competencies which  facilitate organizational restructuring during and after a crisis.<br>
  1- Building an environment of trust.<br>
  2- Reforming the organization&rsquo;s  mindset.<br>
  3- Identifying obvious and obscure  vulnerabilities of the organization.<br>
  4- Making wise and rapid decisions  as well as taking courageous action.<br>
  5- Learning from crisis to effect  change.<br>
  Crisis  leadership research concludes that leadership action in crisis reflects the  competency of an organization, because the test of crisis demonstrates how well  the institution&rsquo;s leadership structure serves the organization&rsquo;s goals and  withstands crisis.</p>
<p align="center">IV- SUCCESSFUL  &amp; UNSUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT: CASE STUDIES OF PARTICULAR  COMPANIES.<br>
  Here at <em>Crisis</em> management we have one  investment philosophy: Looking for value excellence at the right price is the  only reliable way to build wealth, year after year with the least risk. <em>Chris Mayer</em> says that it doesn&rsquo;t change  as fads come and go. <em>He also </em>helps you to find businesses with that value with  critical and unbiased research.</p>
<p><em>A. SUCCESSFUL CRISIS MANAGEMENT</em></p>
<p><em>1) Tylenol  (Johnson and Johnson)</em><br>
  In  the fall of 1982, a murderer added 65 milligrams of cyanide to some Tylenol  capsules on store shelves, killing seven people, including three in one family.  Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled and destroyed 31 million capsules at a cost of  $100 million. The affable CEO, James Burke, appeared in television ads and at  news conferences informing consumers of the company's actions. Tamper-resistant  packaging was rapidly introduced, and Tylenol sales swiftly bounced back to  near pre-crisis levels. When another bottle of tainted Tylenol was discovered  in a store, it took only a matter of minutes for the manufacturer to issue a  nationwide warning that people should not use the medication in its capsule  form.</p>
<p><em>2) Odwalla Foods</em><br>
  In  October 1996, an outbreak of E. coli bacteria in Washington State, California,  Colorado and British Columbia was traced to unpasteurized apple juice  manufactured by natural juice maker Odwalla Inc. Forty-nine cases were  reported, including the death of a small child. Within 24 hours, Odwalla  conferred with the FDA and Washington state health officials; established a  schedule of daily press briefings; sent out press releases which announced the  recall; expressed remorse, concern and apology, and took responsibility for  anyone harmed by their products; detailed symptoms of E. coli poisoning; and  explained what consumers should do with any affected products. Odwalla then  developed - through the help of consultants - effective thermal processes that  would not harm the products' flavors when production resumed. All of these  steps were communicated through close relations with the media and through full-page  newspaper ads.</p>
<p><em>3) Mattel Inc.</em><br>
  Mattel  Inc., the toy maker, has been plagued with more than 28 product recalls and in  summer of 2007, amongst problems with exports from China, faced two product recalls  in two weeks. The company &quot;did everything it could to get its message out,  earning high marks from consumers and retailers. Though upset by the situation,  they were appreciative of the company's response. At Mattel, just after the 7  a.m. recall announcement by federal officials, a public relations staff of 16  was set to call reporters at the 40 biggest media outlets. They told each to  check their e-mail for a news release outlining the recalls, invited them to a  teleconference call with executives and scheduled TV appearances or phone  conversations with Mattel's chief executive. The Mattel CEO <em>Robert Eckert</em> did 14 TV interviews on a  Tuesday in August and about 20 calls with individual reporters. By the week's  end, Mattel had responded to more than 300 media inquiries in the U.S.  alone.&quot;</p>
<p><em>4) Pepsi Corporation</em><br>
  The  Pepsi Corporation faced a crisis in 1993 which started with claims of syringes  being found in cans of diet Pepsi. Pepsi urged stores not to remove the product  from shelves while it had the cans and the situation investigated. This led to  an arrest, which Pepsi made public and then followed with their first video  news release, showing the production process to demonstrate that such tampering  was impossible within their factories. A second video news release displayed  the man arrested. A third video news release showed surveillance from a  convenience store where a woman was caught replicating the tampering incident.  The company simultaneously publicly worked with the FDA during the crisis. The  corporation was completely open with the public throughout, and every employee  of Pepsi was kept aware of the details. This made public communications  effective throughout the crisis. After the crisis had been resolved, the  corporation ran a series of special campaigns designed to thank the public for  standing by the corporation, along with coupons for further compensation. This  case served as a design for how to handle other crisis situations.</p>
<p><em> B.UNSUCCESSFUL CRISIS MANAGEMENT</em><br>
  <em>1)</em><em>Bhopal</em><br>
  The  Bhopal disaster in which poor communication before, during, and after the  crisis cost thousands of lives, illustrates the importance of incorporating  cross-cultural communication in crisis management plans. According to American  University&rsquo;s Trade Environmental Database Case Studies (1997), local residents  were not sure how to react to warnings of potential threats from the Union  Carbide plant. Operating manuals printed only in English is an extreme example  of mismanagement but indicative of systemic barriers to information diffusion.  According to Union Carbide&rsquo;s own chronology of the incident (2006), a day after  the crisis Union Carbide&rsquo;s upper management arrived in India but was unable to  assist in the relief efforts because they were placed under house arrest by the  Indian government. Symbolic intervention can be counterproductive; a crisis  management strategy can help upper management make more calculated decisions in  how they should respond to disaster scenarios. The Bhopal incident illustrates  the difficulty in consistently applying management standards to multi-national operations  and the blame shifting that often results from the lack of a clear management  plan.</p>
<p><em>2) Ford and  Firestone Tire and Rubber Company</em><br>
  The  Ford-Firestone Tire and Rubber Company dispute transpired in August 2000. In  response to claims that their 15-inch Wilderness AT, radial ATX and ATX II tire  treads were separating from the tire core leading to grisly, spectacular  crashes. Bridgestone/Firestone recalled 6.5 million tires. These tires were  mostly used on the Ford Explorer, the world's top-selling sport utility vehicle  (SUV). The two companies&rsquo; committed three major blunders early on, say crisis  experts. First, they blamed consumers for not inflating their tires properly.  Then they blamed each other for faulty tires and faulty vehicle design. Then  they said very little about what they were doing to solve a problem that had  caused more than 100 deaths, until they got called to Washington to testify  before Congress.</p>
<p><em>3)</em><em>Exxon  Corporation </em><br>
  On  March 24, 1989, a tanker belonging to the Exxon Corporation ran aground in the  Prince William Sound in Alaska. The Exxon spilled millions of gallons of crude  oil into the waters of Valdez, killing thousands of fish, fowl, and sea otters.  Hundreds of miles of coastline were polluted and salmon spawning runs  disrupted; numerous fishermen, especially Native Americans, lost their  livelihoods. Exxon, by contrast, did not react quickly in terms of dealing with  the media and the public; the CEO, <em>Lawrence  Rawl</em>, did not become an active part of the public relations effort and actually  shunned public involvement; the company had neither a communication plan nor a  communication team in place to handle the event, in fact, the company did not  appoint a public relations manager to its management team until 1993, 4 years  after the incident; Exxon established its media center in Valdez, a location  too small and too remote to handle the onslaught of media attention; and the  company acted defensively in its response to its publics, even laying blame, at  times, on other groups such as the Coast Guard. These responses also happened  within days of the incident.</p>
<p align="center">V- ANALYSIS<br>
  One  of the foremost recognized studies conducted on <em>the impact of a catastrophe on the</em> <em>stockholder value</em> of an organization was completed by <em>Dr Rory Knight</em> and <em>Dr Deborah Pretty</em>.  This study undertook a detailed analysis of the stock price (post impact) of  organizations that had experienced catastrophes. The study identified  organizations that recovered and even exceeded pre-catastrophe stock price, &ldquo;<em>Recoverers</em>&rdquo;,  and those that did not recover on stock price, &ldquo;<em>Non-recoverers</em>&rdquo;. The  average cumulative impact on shareholder value for the recoverers was 5% plus  on their original stock value. So the net impact on shareholder value by this  stage was actually positive. The non-recoverers remained more or less unchanged  between days 5 to 50 after the catastrophe, but suffered a net negative  cumulative impact of almost 15% on their stock price up to one year afterwards.  The key of this study is that &quot;Effective management of the consequences of  catastrophes would appear to be a more significant factor than whether  catastrophe insurance hedges the economic impact of the catastrophe&quot;. <br>
  Furthermore,  politics and crisis go hand-in-hand nowadays. In describing crisis, President <em>Abraham Lincoln </em>said, &ldquo;We live in the midst of alarms, anxiety beclouds the future; we  expect some new disaster with each newspaper we read.&rdquo; Crisis  management has become a defining feature of contemporary governance. In times  of crisis, communities and members of organizations expect their public leaders  to minimize the impact of the crisis at hand, while critics and bureaucratic  competitors try to seize the moment to blame incumbent  rulers and their policies. <br>
  Also,  in the face of crisis, leaders must deal with the strategic challenges they  face, the political risks and opportunities they encounter, the errors they  make, the pitfalls they need to avoid, and the paths away from crisis they may  pursue. The necessity for management is even more significant with the advent  of a 24-hour news cycle and an increasingly internet-savvy audience with  ever-changing technology at its fingertips. <br>
  Public  leaders have a special responsibility to help safeguard society from the  adverse consequences of crisis. Experts in crisis management note that leaders  who take this responsibility seriously would have to concern themselves with  all crisis phases: the incubation stage, the onset, and the aftermath. Crisis  leadership then involves five critical tasks: sense making, decision making,  terminating, and learning. <br>
  A  brief description of the five facets of crisis leadership includes: <br>
  <strong>1-</strong> Sense making  may be considered as the classical situation assessment step in decision  making. <strong>2-</strong> Decision making is both  the act of coming to a decision as the implementation of that decision. <strong>3-</strong> Meaning making refers to crisis  management as political communication. <strong>4-</strong> Terminating a crisis is only possible if the public leader or company&rsquo;s leader  correctly handles the accountability question. <strong>5-</strong> Learning from a crisis. Authors note that, a crisis often opens  a window of opportunity for reform for better or for worse.<br>
  Finally, crisis management can be perceive as an  opportunity, this is because to address such shareholder impact,  management must move from a mindset that manages crisis to one that generates  crisis leadership. Research shows that organizational contributory factors  affect the tendency of executives to adopt an effective &quot;crisis as  opportunity&quot; mindset. <br>
  James contends that most executives focus on communications  and public relations as a reactive strategy. While the company&rsquo;s reputation  with shareholders, financial well-being, and survival are all at stake;  potential damage to reputation can result from the actual management of the  crisis issue. Additionally, companies may stagnate as their risk management  group identifies whether a crisis is sufficiently &ldquo;statistically significant&rdquo;.  Crisis leadership, on the other hand, immediately addresses both the damage and  implications for the company&rsquo;s present and future conditions, as well as  opportunities for improvement. </p>
<p align="center">VI-  RECOMMENDATION &amp; CONCLUSION<br>
  In  general, a reputation is how stakeholder perceives an organization.&nbsp; A  reputation is widely recognized as a valuable, intangible asset for an  organization and is worth protecting.&nbsp; But the threat posed by a crisis  extends to behavioral intentions as well.&nbsp; Increased attributions of  organizational responsibility for a crisis result in a greater likelihood of  negative word-of-mouth about the organization and reduced purchase intention  from the organization.&nbsp; Early research suggests that lessons designed to  protect the organization&rsquo;s reputation will help to reduce the likelihood of  negative word-of-mouth and the negative effect on purchase intentions as well.</p>
<p><em>A. RECOMMENDATION: POST- CRISIS</em><br>
  In  the post-crisis phase, organization is returning to business, however crisis is  no longer the focal point of management&rsquo;s attention but still requires some  attention and follow-up communication.&nbsp; As noted, reputation repair may be  continued during this phase.&nbsp; </p>

  <strong><em>1st</em></strong>,  crisis managers often promise to provide additional information during the  crisis phase.&nbsp; The crisis managers must deliver on those informational  promises or risk losing the trust of anxious publics. <strong><em>2nd</em></strong>, the organization  needs to release updates on the recovery process, corrective actions, and/or  investigations of the crisis.&nbsp; The amount of follow-up communication  required depends on the amount of information promised (to reporters) during  the crisis and the length of time it takes to complete the recovery  process.&nbsp;For example, West Pharmaceuticals provided recovery updates for  over a year because that is how long it took to build a new facility to replace  the one destroyed in an explosion.&nbsp; As Dowling (2003), the Corporate  Leadership Counsel (2003), and the Business Roundtable (2002) observed,  Intranets&nbsp;actually, shows how mass notification systems can be used as  well to deliver update messages to employees and other publics via phones, text  messages, voice messages, and e-mail.  <strong><em>3rd</em></strong>,  Crisis managers agree that a crisis should be a learning experience.&nbsp; The  crisis management effort needs to be evaluated to see what is working and what  needs improvement.&nbsp; The same holds true for exercises.&nbsp; Therefore <em>Coombs</em> in one of his reviews of 2006 recommended that every crisis management exercise  should be carefully dissected as a learning experience.&nbsp; The organization  should seek ways to improve prevention, preparation, and responses.&nbsp; As  most books on crisis management note, those lessons are then integrated into  the pre-crisis and crisis response phases.&nbsp;  </p>
<p><em>B. CONCLUSION</em><br>
  It is  difficult to distill all that is known about crisis management into one concise  entry.&nbsp; I have tried to identify the best practices and lessons created by  crisis management researchers and analysts.&nbsp; While crises begin as a  negative threat, effective crisis management can minimize the damage and in  some case, allow an organization to emerge stronger than before the  crisis.&nbsp; However, crises are not the ideal way to improve an  organization.&nbsp; But no organization is immune from a crisis, so all must do  their best to prepare for one in a future in come. </p>
