  <p><em>Abstract</em>—This paper reviews both  scholarly and trade literature for contribution into a greater body of  knowledge in identity management (IdM) practices and applications in cloud  infrastructures. Identity management is a lateral iteration in the field of  information security. In this paper classical and emergent identity management views  are defined along with practices and applications. The benefits and challenges  in identity management are surfaced, the cloud environment is defined, and the  case is made for security within the environment and how identity management  facilitates greater control over the access and confidentiality of user and  enterprise data both stored and transmitted. Advances in identity management, cloud  systems, and private and public key cryptosystems are also explored with a  specific review of the three main IdM cloud practices: OpenID, security  assertion markup language (SAML) and Microsoft Infocard.<br>
    Keywords-identity  management; security; cloud; OpenID, SAML, Infocard</p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p> There are several  benefits to traditional identity management (IdM) such as lowered security  management costs and reduced costs of IT administration [2]. Improved employee  productivity is increased since less time is spent dealing with the frequent  issue of credential management which has primarily been the responsibility of  the end user. Also, by delivering user identity information from a single  source, end-user verification is made available, on demand, to logical  peripheral systems. This paper provides a review of practical and theoretical  work in the area of information security and, more specifically, identity  management, to effectively draw a knowledge map of the field as it relates  cloud security practices and management. <br>
    Ohio State&rsquo;s Identity Management program  defines IdM as &ldquo;a set of processes used to manage the identities in an  identity store which includes the process of collecting information from the  authoritative sources into a single location.&rdquo; [16]. For this  paper the selected literature was reviewed and categorized  into one of three groups covering cloud infrastructure, general information  security, and identity management. The fields were evaluated topically then  identity management current practices were identified and summarized.<br>
    Identity management affects more than those specifically  within the field and technical vocation of information systems and technology. In a recent survey of small business owners conducted  for Bloomberg Businessweek.com by the professional social networking site  LinkedIn, three-fourths of the 65 respondents cited IdM as their biggest  concern over cloud-based apps [5].&nbsp;It is important to address issues  that may be found on the periphery of cloud security, identity management  practices and concerns, network security and cryptographic systems so that such  information can be converted to high-level knowledge that can be made useful by  those in higher, non-technical levels of management. These individuals would  primarily be concerned with leveraging risk and its associated costs, and  taking information from the independent, departmental knowledge silos and  distributing it appropriately across the cloud reliably and securely.</p>
  <h1>The Problem of Security</h1>
  <p>Organizations implementing an information  security program are often faced with several challenges with concerns  surrounding data transmission, storage, migration and recovery. In a cloud  environment additional concerns arise when considering stored end-user  attribute data and profiles, public/private cloud partnerships, and public key  infrastructure authentication mechanisms. While organizations are in wide  support of the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, there is still an issue with  bringing current products up to IPv6 capability as it is a separate protocol  and as such brings new security risks. Until there is substantial assurance  that the increased number of available IP addresses will have the same protocol  transparency and governance from IPv4 the end-user is still vulnerable to the  same content-based threats [6]. Organizations need to be persuaded to fully  adopt and secure the IPv6 network structure in consideration of implementing  any cloud infrastructure. </p>
  <h1>The Cloud Environment</h1>
  <p>Cloud computing is an emergent, employable  tool for organizations to use in order to cut data storage costs, reduce the  time to move an application from a development to a production environment,  lower virtualization costs and deploying decision systems modules to  end-users.  According to Ramgovind, Eloff,  and Smith [18] cloud computing is used to keep IT budgets down, keep conceptual  investments costs low, and can be part of a larger organizational solution by  placing key applications within the cloud to take advantage of the cloud&rsquo;s  processing power, while keeping mission critical systems on organizational  resources thereby leveraging the computing power so as not to drain services.<br>
    As more organizations, as well as  individual end-users, begin to employ cloud software, hardware and platform  services the need to keep stored and transmitted data reliable and secure  increases. Cloud security is, as it should be, an iterative process meaning  that there will not be one clear solution that stands out regarding practices,  protocols and governance for all cloud service providers (CSP) but a feedback  loop with continual progression as to the practical applications of security management.  The type of cloud an organization chooses to employ will inherently define its  own security criteria and hardware needs. Currently, there are three types of  clouds: public clouds which connect users to the Internet, private clouds which  typically run internal applications and store data locally, and hybrid clouds  that essentially provide the organization with an internal and external  web-based presence.</p>
  <h1>Security Concerns Within the Cloud Environment</h1>
  <p>An overview of literature on this topic  brings forward not only the narrowed perspectives and solutions provided by  those studying industry practices and concerns, but access to a host of  implicit and inferred issues on the periphery identifying issues involving data  storage, physical security, end-user privacy, data integrity and availability,  and identity management. Mather, Kumaraswamy, and Latif [12] identify two broad  categories when classifying multiple security issues: Security issues faced by  cloud providers (organizations providing Software-, Platform-, or  Infrastructure-as-a-Service via the cloud) and security issues faced by their  customers. As such, literature proposing new security management frameworks and  analysis data obtained through case study is substantive and readily available.<br>
    Just as the types of clouds are  dissimilar, so are the concerns regarding privacy and security different  depending on the type of cloud service being used. For example, an organization  with a hybrid cloud infrastructure will be concerned about both maintaining the  privacy of internal, confidential data such as research and development, as  well as making sure that user data is not compromised as moves from the private  to the public cloud by hyper-linking to a vendor site from within an  organizational dashboard accessed using a single sign-on authenticated method. <br>
    IBM is also focused on the security within  hybrid cloud infrastructures. In the June 2011 issue of NetworkWorld, a trade  publication, Steve Robinson, a general manager for IBM security solutions  stated that &ldquo;enterprises  using clouds should be able to establish means of authentication, provisioning  of resources and de-provisioning of them in an automated way&rdquo; [14]. IBM is  researching monitoring systems which would have the ability to determine  breaches in security and policy violations in real-time. The system, which is  developed using IBM&rsquo;s own Infosphere stream data analysis tool, Cognos business  intelligence and IBM&rsquo;s predictive analysis SPSS software used for audit control  will potentially have the capability to &ldquo;detect an upset employee who comes in  on a Saturday and walks out with 4GB of data&rdquo; [14] according to Robinson.</p>
  <h1>Traditional Identity Management </h1>
  <p>Identity management is similar to  information security; specifically traditional biometric systems in that it  involves the identification and authentication of humans across computer  networks. The term &ldquo;identity&rdquo; for the purpose of this paper is synonymous with  personally identifiable information (PII). This can include but is not limited  to an individual&rsquo;s email address, financial and medical records, criminal  history, social security number, biometric records, and passport numbers [13]. <br>
    According to the University of Buffalo  [21] information security office, identity management can be given three perspectives:  pure identity paradigm, user-access or logon paradigm, and service paradigm. In  the classic pure identity model general identities are constructed from a small  set of principles. All identities are unique and distinctive and have a  specific relationship to corresponding entities in the real world. The model is  not restricted by its applied context and can have multiple identities, each  consisting of multiple attributes and/or identifiers thus providing a virtually  pure identity. Josang and Pope [7] identify, in their research, the conceptual  relationship between entities, identities, and their attributes/identifiers. The  user access and service paradigms involve familiar log-on, organizational  perspectives and are integrated systems of processes, policies and technologies  that aid in protecting confidential information from unauthorized access [21].</p>
  <h1>Challenges in Traditional Environments</h1>
  <p>With the inherent benefits organizations  can realize with identity and access management software it is not without  complications in configuration, implementation and use. It can be common to  have long implementation times to integrate each application, and laborious  development and maintenance efforts which translate into longer time to  introduce into the production environment to demonstrate value for the  organization. The total cost of ownership can also be high with initial startup  costs, services-to-license ratios, and the need for specialized IT support  staff. Federated identity can potentially increase the complexity of an  organization&rsquo;s security model, as each system is required to establish a  trusted link with every other system, creating a star-based topology of  connections [10]. Also, the process of de-provisioning is open to error and  omission. Former employees can be blocked off from the corporate network but  may still retain access the public cloud (Internet) or other web services.<strong></strong></p>
  <h1>Identity Management in the Cloud</h1>
  <p>As single-sign-on (SSO) applications  helped to enhance enterprise information security on the desktop and network  levels, there is now a need to extend identity and access management (IAM)  models into the cloud infrastructure. The barriers to entry of an IAM model in  the cloud is often compared with the barriers that preceded them within  traditional identity management frameworks such as high upfront costs, hidden  maintenance costs, vendor lock-in and reduced scalability. <br>
    There are three main federated identity  protocols [9]:</p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Security Assertion Markup       Language<strong> (</strong>SAML)</li>
    <li>OpenID specification and</li>
    <li>InfoCard specification       underlying Microsoft's Windows Cardspace</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SAML is used by most organizations however  is gaining increasing notoriety. SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging  authentication and authorization data between both producers and consumers of  assertions otherwise known as identity  providers and service providers. SAML attempts to solve the Web Browser Single Sign-On (SSO)  problem which is also addressed by OpenID. <br>
    OpenID is the open standard that examines how users are authenticated in a  decentralized manner, eliminating the need for organizations to develop ad hoc  systems and allowing users to consolidate their digital identities [4]. In the  OpenID protocol, which does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a  user's identity, &ldquo;neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a  specific means by which to authenticate users, allowing for approaches ranging  from the common (such as passwords) to the novel (such as smart cards or  biometrics)&rdquo; [4].</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Enterprise cloud infrastructures require  unique and anonymous storage, message authentication, encryption and  decryption. Currently, end-users accessing resources from multiple providers  have authentication issues due to the separate requirements of each individual  provider. Bertino,  Paci, Ferrini, and Shang [1] propose an answer to this issue through an Aggregate Zero Knowledge Proof of Knowledge (AgZKPK)  solution for managing authenticating users from the client to the cloud service  provider (CSP). This is possible by allowing one entity to submit (client-side)  identity attributes to the provider via a portal and the CSP verifies that the  values match syntactically and semantically through ontological mappings providing  a multi-factor type of authentication. <br>
    Oracle is also developing new  service-oriented capabilities in identity management with the 11g Identity  Management product line. This service aims to &ldquo;optimized and support the  evolving needs of modern enterprises, such as cloud computing, with a unified,  secure easy-to-deploy set of identity management functions&rdquo; [17]. In this  paper, the overall issue of security was addressed. The traditional identity  management framework was explored identifying key attributes or identifiers  associated with user identities specifically as it relates to single sign-on  platforms. Current and emerging practices in identity management were also  identified keying in on barriers of entry as well as best practices to help  ensure successful implementation. The literature provides much promise to the future  of identity management and enterprises would benefit from further research in  this area specifically as it relates to scalable data-grid centers,  virtualization, and connecting internal and external clients via hybrid cloud  systems.</p>
