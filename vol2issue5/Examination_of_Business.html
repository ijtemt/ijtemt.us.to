This study offers new insight into business traveler’s perceptions and intentions towards hotel technology.  In particular, this study attempts to investigate the attitudes of business travelers who adopt hotel technology while traveling, especially as perceived ease of use and usefullness impacts intention and the adoption of hotel technology. A measurement model was developed and used to investigate the relevant relationships among the constructs viewed through the lens of the technology acceptance model and analyzed using structural equation modeling. As expected, business traveler’s intention to engage in hotel technology was positively associated with the technology’s ease of use and usefulness.

  <p>This study offers new insight  into business traveler&rsquo;s perceptions and intentions towards hotel  technology.  In particular, this study  attempts to investigate the attitudes of business travelers who adopt hotel  technology while traveling, especially as perceived ease of use and usefullness  impacts intention and the adoption of hotel technology. A measurement model was  developed and used to investigate the relevant relationships among the  constructs viewed through the lens of the technology acceptance model and  analyzed using structural equation modeling. As expected, business traveler&rsquo;s  intention to engage in hotel technology was positively associated with the  technology&rsquo;s ease of use and usefulness. In particular, this study found that  perceived ease of use of hotel technology was a stronger driver of the intent  to engage in hotel technology than perceived usefulness of hotel technology.<br>

  <h1><em>Introduction</em></h1>
  <p>In  2012, companies in the United States spent more than $250 billion on business  travel (U.S. Travel Association, 2012).    It is widely recognized that business travelers have unique  characteristics and technology needs compared to leisure travelers (e.g.,.  access to relevant business information, business center services, internet  accessibility and speed).  A business  traveler must be productive while traveling and therefore is often dependent on  the proximity and availability of power, Internet connectivity and  communication technologies. According to travelers surveyed in 2009 by American  Airlines, more than one-quarter (26%) of frequent business travelers polled  identified the inability to locate power as a major complaint when traveling  (American Airlines and HP, 2009). Furthermore, nearly one-half (47%) of those  surveyed also identified Wi-Fi access as the most important airport amenity,  thus outscored other basic travel needs, such as food, by nearly 30 percentage  points, thereby highlighting the importance of connectivity to productivity. &ldquo;Business  travelers expect connectivity and see it as a necessity, not a luxury,&quot;  said Carol Hess-Nickels, director of marketing in HP's Notebook Global Business  Unit (2009). <br>
    Technology  has been described as a primary ingredient for service firms to add value to  what they offer both their internal and external customers (Lee et. al.,  2003).  A focus on improving the &ldquo;guest  experience,&rdquo; in all categories of lodging, has been responsible for driving  continual transformation in hospitality technology offerings. Uber high-speed  internet access, property-wide wireless coverage, video conferencing and new  guest room business and entertainment technologies are among the leading-edge  developments for today&rsquo;s hotel environment. Accordingly, business travelers  expect technologies found on the road to be of the same caliber and to offer  the same capabilities as technologies they use in other areas of their live  (i.e. working from home, leisure travel, etc.).<br>
    Considering  the competitiveness of the lodging environment and the significant impact the  recent economic environment has had on hotel occupancy, average daily rate and  revenue per available room, hoteliers need to better understand and serve their  guests. One way to gain competitive advantage is to foresee and manage the  expectations of business travelers and their use of technology in order to  drive traveler productivity, customer satisfaction and repeat patronage.  Technology is typically applied at two levels in hotels: (1) in-room (guest  room) services; and (2) the managerial and operations level. <br>
    In  the past, the technologies that hoteliers have chosen to invest in have largely  been based on corporate dictate, competitive offers, direct customer feedback  and/or a combination of all these factors.   Capital investments in new technologies were subject to gaps between  consumer demand, actual usage and rapid technological evolution.   The desire to have certain technologies  shown in customer feedback may differ than what is actually being used by the  guest. This makes it challenging for hoteliers to plan for, purchase or upgrade  technology to properly service guests&rsquo; needs while making intelligent  investments decisions for the hotel. Since technologies evolve at a very rapid  pace they often become quickly obsolete, therefore compounding the problem of  matching business traveler demand with the technology supplied by the hotel.  One way for hotel owners and managers to  determine in which technology to invest in the future is to explore and  identify the actual preferences and technology usage of business travelers.<br>
    The  purpose of this study is three fold: (1) to explore business traveler use and  perceived usefulness of different types of hotel technologies; (2) to  investigate business traveler attitudes toward the adoption of hotel  technology; and (3) to inform hotelier strategy for investment in technology  based on business traveler technology preferences and intentions.<br>
    Although  there are numerous studies about the ways in which travelers are using hotel  technology (Lubbe et al., 2010; Kah et al., 2008); Chia-Yu Chen, 2007) there  are few studies about the types of technology used by business travelers and  their perceptions of the available hotel technology offerings.  This study allows for future examination of  this groups desire, usage, and intentions toward hotel guest room technology.  Current research has largely focused on examining  technology adoption and usage by employees (Siguaw et al., 2000); however  business traveler acceptance and use of hotel technology is largely missing in  current hospitality research.  This study  attempts to address business travelers&rsquo; acceptance of technology by presenting  a modified technology acceptance model (TAM) and examining what they perceive  as useful hotel technology (e.g., the hotel&rsquo;s internet) and their perceived  ease of use, or in this case, their &ldquo;likeliness to engage&rdquo; in hotel technology.  Customers as a market segment, and, business  travelers for this study, may desire to have certain technology, however when  it comes to what technology is actually used, a gap is formed which makes it  challenging for management to purchase technology for its property.  Therefore, insights provided from research on  the perception, behavior and intentions of business travelers may be useful for  management when making hotel technology investment decisions.  The insights gleaned from this research will  also assist hotel management and technology providers to better understand the  drivers of technology use by tech-savvy business travelers.  </p>
  <h1><em>Literature review</em></h1>
  <h2>Technology Acceptance Model</h2>
  <p>The  technology acceptance model has been widely applied in consumer behavior  research on the acceptance of information technologies (IT) and information  systems (IS).  The TAM, first proposed by  Davis (1986), was conceived in an attempt to predict and explain an  individual&rsquo;s IT or IS acceptance. The TAM is an adaptation of the Ajzen and  Fishbein&rsquo;s (1980) Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), which is a basis for  specifying the causal linkage and flow of a sequence of beliefs, attitude  towards use, and behavioral intention to use information technology and  systems. The intention to use IT/IS is jointly determined by a consumers&rsquo;  attitude toward the use of technology and the perceived usefulness of  technology, where perceived usefulness directly influences a consumers attitude  towards its usage.  The theory of  reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) also proposed by Ajzen  (1985), laid the theoretical foundation of the technology acceptance model  which proposes that consumer behavior is driven by attitude and intention. A  significant amount of a prior research has focused on measuring the effects of  consumer perceptions (e.g., perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of  technology) on consumer attitudes towards technology, intention to use  technology, and actual usage of technology. <br>
    The  technology acceptance model has received much academic attention, and  comprehensive summaries of the literature and its adaptations can be found in  Lee (2006), who examined the impact of select lifestyle factors on consumers&rsquo;  perception and adoption of technology products; Lee, Kim and Lee (2006) and  Wang and Qualls (2007) examined the relationship between managers&rsquo; perceptions  and beliefs toward information technology systems and processes and managers  daily usage.<br>
    The  technology acceptance model has been applied in the context of internet  commerce (Dunn, 2005) and has been found to be a robust, powerful, and  parsimonious model for predicting user acceptance of technology.  In 2010, the Institute for Scientific  Information&rsquo;s Social Science Citation Index listed over 2300 citations to the  two the research that first introduced TAM (Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989). The  TAM proposes that behavioral intention is a significant determiner of actual  system use, and that behavioral intention is determined by two salient beliefs:  perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.   According to TAM, individuals&rsquo; beliefs determine their attitude towards,  and usage of, an information technology or system.<br>
    For  the purposes of this paper, TAM is used as the theoretical framework to examine  business traveler&rsquo;s perceptions and intentions toward hotel technology (Figure  1).  It is reasoned that if a consumer  has positive perceptions towards an object, generally their intention to engage  and use that object is favorable. Across the many empirical tests of TAM,  perceived usefulness has consistently been found as a strong determinant of  consumer intention and use of technology, while perceived ease of use, has been  found to have a lesser effect on consumer intention toward technology  (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000).  A better  understanding of the drivers of hotel technology preference and use would help  to inform hotel managers in their planning and purchasing of hotel information  technology and systems. Fig. 1 depicts the hypothesized model used to analyze  the relationships between: (1) perceived usefulness and intention to engage in  hotel technology; (2) perceived ease of use and intention to use hotel  technology; (3) intention to engage in hotel technology and actual use of hotel  technology; and (4) perceived usefulness of hotel technology and perceived ease  of use of hotel technology. <br>

  <h1><em>Methodology</em></h1>
  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Data  for the study was collected using a self-administered 30-minute survey  distributed via email to 12,500 pre-qualified members of an industry leading  marketing research firms&rsquo; U.S.-based consumer panel. Respondents were  pre-qualified along the following criteria: (1) active business travelers  (e.g., defined as having taken more than four business trips of at least 75  miles or more from home during the previous 12 months in which they stayed in  commercial lodging, and (2) active users of technology (e.g., consider  themselves to be active users of personal, business and entertainment  technologies), and 3) geo-demographics (i.e. U.S. residents aged 18 years and  older).</p>
  <h2>Instrument</h2>
  <p>A  multi-stage process was employed for the development of the questionnaire.  First, preliminary measures of the variables included in the study were adapted  from previous research that investigated consumer use, preference and  intentions toward technology. The questionnaire contained 5 sections: (1) trip  characteristics and preferences, (2) personal technology ownership and usage,  (3) lodging technology preferences and usage, (4) interest in personalization  of future technology, and (5) demography. <br>
    The  majority of the interview time was spent asking respondents about their  ownership, usage, preferences and intentions toward personal and hotel  technologies. In particular, respondents were asked 10 questions related to  their business trip characteristics (e.g., when traveling for business, which  type of lodging accommodations do you prefer?) and preferences (e.g. please  rate the desirability of having each of the following technologies available to  you in a hotel or resort); 14 questions related to personal technology  ownership and usage (e.g., regarding Web-based phone service, which of the  following do you currently utilize?); 10 questions related to lodging technology  preferences and usage (e.g., when videoconferencing while traveling for  business, which of the following do you prefer to use?); 4 questions on their  interest in personalization of technology (e.g., rate your level of interest in  using technology to engage in personalizing your hotel/resort stay); and 6  questions on demography (e.g., please indicate your total annual household  income).<br>
    Questions  related to the perceived usefulness of hotel technology were derived from Lai  &amp; Li, (2005) and Shih (2004) using 13 items (e.g., use of internet  concierge support available through the toll-free hotline, choosing pricing  options based on the speed of internet connection price), while questions  related to the perceived ease of use of hotel technology were derived from Hsu  &amp; Lin (2004) using sixteen items (e.g., watching a full length TV program  through the internet, downloading movies onto an Ipod, carrying a laptop on  business trips). Questions related to the intention to use technology were  derived from Morosan &amp; Jeong (2008) using fifteen items (e.g., availability  of wired access in guest rooms, availability of wireless access in meeting  rooms, free internet in guest rooms). Questions related to the actual usage of  hotel technology were derived from several studies including Lee et al. (2003,  2006) using nine items (e.g., responsiveness of tech support staff, reliability  of the internet connection). The final section of the questionnaire contained  seven questions related to demographic information (e.g., gender, age,  household income, marital status, and race).  <br>
    A  pre-test was administered to further refine the attitudinal and behavioral  measures derived from the literature review. Thirty-five travel marketing  professionals who met the screening criteria participated in the pretest.  Participants were asked to take the survey online and provide feedback to  ensure all instructions and questions were understood as intended. The initial  emailing to consumers was followed by 4 reminders sent every 5 days after. Respondents  who opted out or communicated their preference to be taken off the mailing list  were deleted appropriately from the email list of participants. The survey  resulted in an 8.8% delivery rate and a 5.2 % usable response rate (n = 651  usable questionnaires). Specifically, of the 1100 respondent visits to the  survey, 651 were completed while 449 were partially completed and or deemed  unusable- and thus discarded. The unusable questionnaires were due to the  following reasons: (1) a large number of missing responses, (2) respondents did  not meet the minimum qualifying question of having booked at least four  business trips during the past year, or (3) the focus on the business travel  and use of technology may have initiated consumer hesitancy in participation  due to concerns about privacy, spam and sharing of personal information  (Miyazaki and Fernandez 2000). Based on these considerations, the response rate  and the net usable responses were considered acceptable for further study.  </p>
  <h1><em>Results</em></h1>
  <p>The  properties of the four  research  constructs (two exogenous variables– perceived usefulness of hotel technology  and perceived ease of use of hotel technology; and two endogenous variables-  intention to engage in hotel technology and actual use of technology in) were tested  with anMPlus 5.2 application of structural equation modeling (SEM) software  (Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2009).  SEM is  designed to evaluate how well a proposed conceptual model that contains  observed indicators and hypothetical constructs explains or fits the collected  data (Bollen, 1990; Yoon, Gursoy, &amp; Chen, 2001).  It also provides the ability to measure or  specify the causal relationships among sets of unobserved constructs and  theory.  The SEM procedure was an  appropriate application for analyzing the proposed hypothetical model.</p>
  <h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
  <p>A  sample of six hundred and fifty-one completed questionnaires was deemed usable  for further statistical analysis. More than one-third (36%) of respondents were  classified as half (earn an annual household income of more than $75,000 per  year, and six in ten (respondents have taken between four and seven overnight  business trips during the previous year. Nearly all (97%) respondents have used  the internet while staying at a hotel or resort during the previous 12 months  and approximately seven in ten (68%)% use both wireless and wired connections  while staying in a hotel or resort.  <br>

  <h2>Reliability and Validity</h2>
  <p>The  reliability of each construct was measured by computing the composite  reliability Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha coefficients (Table 1). Kaiser (1974) recommends  accepting variables for further analysis with reliability coefficient values  above 0.8.The reliability coefficients for the four constructs were: (1)  perceived usefulness of hotel technology (0.88), (2) perceived ease of use of  hotel technology (.92), (3) intention to engage in hotel technology (.92), and  (4) actual use of hotel technology (.93). In addition, discriminant validity of  the four constructs was also confirmed and found to be satisfactory. All  correlation coefficient values fell in the acceptable range (e.g., between .85  and .10) according to Kline, 1998.   Additionally the average variance extracted (AVE) for all four  constructs exceeded the target threshold value of .5 (Fornell &amp; Larckaer,  1981) and the square root of AVE of each construct exceeded target values as  recommended by Gefen &amp; Straub, 2005. </p>

  <h2>Exploratory Factor Analysis</h2>
  <p>Exploratory  factor analysis (EFA) was employed to uncover the underlying structure of the  variables that comprised perceived ease of use of hotel technology and  perceived usefulness of hotel technology. EFA is commonly used to identify the  underlying relationships between measured variables and when developing scales  and identifying a set of latent constructs within a battery of measured  variables (Hair et al. 2003). Three factors were derived for perceived ease of  use with hotel technology (Table 2) and include: (1) watching TV and movies  through the computer, (2) Ipod use, and (3) travel with laptops. Two factors  were derived for perceived usefulness of hotel technology: (1) pricing options  and (2) availability of wireless internet. </p>

  <h2>Overall Model Fit</h2>
  <p>Path  analysis using MPlus Version 5.21 was employed to test the hypotheses of all  four constructs.  The path model was  estimated for the Hotel Technology Acceptance Model as shown in Figure 2.  The model included 53 items describing four  latent constructs: perceived usefulness of hotel technology, perceived ease of  use of hotel technology, intention to engage in hotel technology and actual use  of hotel technology.  The measurement  model test resulted in a good fit between the data and the proposed measurement  model.  At the overall model level, the  goodness of fit indices for the measurement model were (CFI =0.925 and  RMSEA=0.051), which met the recommended values for goodness of fit (e.g.,  CFI&gt;.90 and RMSEA&lt;.05) met.   Chi-square statistical analysis was also used to evaluate how well the  model reproduced the sample covariance/correlation matrix.  The final 37 item, two factor model had a  significant chi-square (χ2=2454.231, p&lt;001, df = 952).  The normed chi-square value (χ2/df = 2.6)  indicated a marginal fit against the recommended value of χ2/df&lt;5.0 (Tanaka  &amp; Huba, 1985).  However, since  chi-square is sample size sensitive it is often found as significant when a  sample size is larger than 100 (Hair, et al 1998). <br>
    To  determine the structural model fit, additional goodness of fit indices (e.g.  CFI, SRMR) and root mean square of approximation (RMSEA) were examined.  An acceptable model fit should have a CFI  value greater than .90 (Kline, 2005). RMSEA is a parsimony-adjusted index in  that its formula includes a built-in correction for model complexity.  This means that given two models with similar  overall explanatory power for the same data, the simpler model will be favored  (Kline, 2005).  While the CFI is  generally used as a key indicator of a models goodness of fit to the data,  RMSEA is sometimes viewed as a &lsquo;badness-of-fit&rdquo; index in that a value of zero  indicates the best fit and higher values indicate a worse fit between the model  and the data.  Therefore, a rule of thumb  is that a RMSEA value of less than .05 indicates a close approximate fit, while  RMSEA values between .05 and .08 suggest a reasonable error of approximation  and fit, and RMSEA values of more than.10 suggest a poor fit (Brown &amp;  Cudeck, 1993).  Tests of the initial  hypothesized model resulted in mixed goodness of fit indices (e.g., a  satisfactory RMSEA value of 0.049 and an SRMR value of 0.082, yet an unsatisfactory  CFI value of .913).  <br>
    The  study then looked to improve the model fit by examining factor loading  reliabilities, and modification indices.   First, a review of all factor loadings was made to ensure significance  at the alpha = 0.05 level.  Next, another  review of the item reliabilities was conducted to ensure all were above the  recommended acceptable value of 0.50 (Hair, et al 1998).  A total of eight of the 37 items were  eliminated from further analysis, resulting in a 29 item final measurement  model.  <br>

  <p>A  test of the final measurement model resulted in a large chi-square statistic  significant at the p&lt;.001 level (χ2=1558.662, p&lt;001, df = 574).  A small chi-square to degrees of freedom  statistic usually indicates a good model fit, but in this case the chi-square  statistic was large and significant suggesting a poor model fit.  The normed chi-square statistic [(χ2/df) =  2.4] also indicated a marginal fit as compared to the preferred normed  chi-square value of χ2/df &lt; 5.0 (Tanaka &amp; Huba, 1985). Moreover, the CFI  for the measurement model (CFI = 0.929) was also found to be satisfactory (e.g.  CFI.&gt;0.90) therefore indicating an acceptable model fit.  A chi-square difference statistical analysis  (χ2D) was then conducted to test the statistical significance of positive or  negative changes in the overall model fit as paths are eliminated (trimmed) or  added (built) (Kline, 2005).  The  analysis of chi-square differences (χ2D = χ2H (866) - χ2M *(574) = 2052.287 –  1558.662, and therefore χ2D (292) = 493.625). The analysis found that the  overall fit of the structural measurement model was found to be statistically  better than the original hypothesized model at the .05 level.<br>
    The  model was then tested by structural equation modeling (SEM), which included a  test of the overall model as well as individual tests of the relationships  among the latent variables. All path coefficients were found to be positive and  significant as shown in Figure 2. Accordingly, all hypothesized relationships  (H1 – H4) between constructs were supported and found significant. As expected,  the intention to engage in hotel technology was positively associated with the  perceived usefulness of hotel technology (β=.15, p&lt;.05), supporting H1.  A stronger, positive association was also  found between the intention to engage in hotel technology and the perceived  ease of use of hotel technology (β=.72, p=&lt;.05), supporting H2.  A positive association between the intention  to engage in hotel technology and actual use of hotel technology was also found  (β=.30, p&lt;.05), supporting H3.   Finally, H4 was supported as there was also a strong and positive  association found between perceived usefulness of hotel technology and  perceived ease of use of hotel technology (β=.76, p&lt;.05).<br>

    <em>An Estimated Hotel Technology Acceptance Model</em></p>
  <h1><em>Discussion and Conclusions</em></h1>
  <p>The purpose of this study was to  (1) explore business traveler perceptions of the ease of use and usefulness of  different types of hotel technologies, (2) investigate perceptions and  intentions toward the adoption and actual use of hotel technology, and (3)  provide suggestions for hotelier investment in information technology and  systems based on business traveler technology preference and usage. Respondents  in the survey were asked to rate listed hotel technologies in terms of  perceived usefulness or ease of use on a five point scale, where 1 equaled not  at all and five equaled very much. The study found that business travelers  perceived free high-speed internet in the guest room (mean=4.56), free wireless  internet in the guest room (mean=4.55), variable pricing options based on the  speed of the internet connection (mean=4.40), and free wireless internet access  in the hotel/resort public areas (mean=4.36) as highest in terms of  perceived  usefulness of hotel  technology, while the ease to which business travelers can download movies  (mean=4.52) and network TV (mean=4.47) as highest in terms of ease of use of  hotel technology. The hotel technologies that business travelers most intend to  engage include sending/receiving email over the internet (4.38), watching news,  sports and weather on the television (4.17), and searching web sites for  detailed information about local restaurants, attractions, special events, to  do while visiting locally (4.09).  The  technologies rated the highest in terms of business traveler actual use include  carrying a cell phone on a business trip (4.59), carrying a cell phone on a  leisure trip (4.57), and carrying a laptop with them on a business trip  (4.45).  <br>
    There are several implications from  this research. First and to the author&rsquo;s knowledge, this is the first study to  use TAM as a conceptual framework and employ structural equation modeling in an  analysis of the proposed set of hotel technology variables. Second, the  technology acceptance model proposed that behavioral intention toward  technology, driven by perceived usefulness and ease of use, is a key  determinant of hotel technology usage. In prior empirical studies and  applications of TAM, perceived usefulness has been identified as a strong  determinant of intention and usage (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). However, in  this study, while perceived usefulness was once again found to be a positive  determinant of intention and usage, it was a fairly weak determinant ((β=.15,  p&lt;.05). In fact, perceived ease of use of technology was found to be a much stronger  determinant of technology intention and usage ((β=.72, p&lt;.05). Furthermore,  this study also confirmed that business traveler perceptions toward the ease of  use of technology have both direct and indirect effect on behavioral intention  to use hotel technology.  More  specifically, the results of the study not only presented the direct effect of  perceived usefulness of hotel technology on intentions, but also indicated an  indirect effect of intention to engage on actual usage. This study found a  strong positive association between perceived ease of use and perceived  usefulness (β=.76, p&lt;.05), which is in line with the findings from prior  studies (Avis, 1989; Chau, 1996).  Finally,  this findings in this study are both similar yet different than that found in  prior research in that consumer intention to engage in technology has a positive  yet moderately weak association with the actual use of technology (β=.30,  p&lt;.05).<br>
    One of the implications from this  study is that hoteliers must recognize the importance of free and or reasonably  priced high-speed wireless access is to business travelers. Hotel managers must  expect to continue to make capital investments in new guest technologies and  internet connectivity in order to meet and exceed future consumer demand for  greater bandwidth as a result of consumer preference for, and adoption of,  increasingly useful and easy to use technologies such as next generation  smartphones, laptop computers and hand-held gaming devices.  There are limitations in this research that  should be considered. First, the sample for the study was generated as a convenience  sample where respondents were pre-qualified and recruited as business travelers  through the use of a leading marketing research panel and therefore the results  of the research may not be generalizable to the population.  Second, the research was conducted with  business travelers residing in the United State and future research is  recommended on consumers residing in different geographic regions. Third, the  research was conducted with consumers who stayed in various hotels and future  research may want to explore traveler attitudes, preferences toward hotel  technology providers or hotel brands. In addition, this model is recommended to  be tested among leisure travelers, and group and convention travelers to  identify similarities and differences on perceptions, intentions and usage of  hotel technologies.</p>
