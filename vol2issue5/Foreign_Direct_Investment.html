<p>Keywords: Indian Retail, single brand retail, multi brand retail,  Foreign Direct Investment, FDI in retail<br>
  I.  Introduction <u> </u></p>
<p>The retail  sector is the backbone of any economy, determining its growth trajectory in a  big way.  India is Asia&rsquo;s largest retail  market after China and Japan and retail is one of the largest employers in  India. The sector has evolved dramatically from traditional village fairs,  street hawkers to resplendent malls and plush outlets, growing from strength to  strength.&nbsp;The retail sector in India includes a variety of product lines  like food retailers, health and beauty products, clothing and footwear, home  furniture &amp; household goods, durable goods and leisure &amp; personal  goods. The food, beverage and clothing segment occupy the largest share and are  growing exponentially. In 2010, the Indian retail market was valued at $435  billion of which the share of modern retail was 7 per cent.  The sector is expected to grow to $535  billion by 2013 with the share of modern retail at 10 per cent (ICRIER, 2011)</p>
<p>The Indian  Government has given green signal to 51% FDI in multi brand retailing and 100%  FDI in single brand retailing. This initiative by the government has, with a  few affirmations, raised many eye brows. The case for FDI is often made on the  basis of increase in employment, wider choices to consumers at a lower price, a  push to domestic industry because of better competition and development of  modern supply chains in India. But the story is far beyond it. There are a  number of stakeholders - farmers, low income consumers, agricultural  intermediaries, the mom and pop stores and the domestic manufacturers at large  who are expected to lose from this policy. </p>
<p>A vast  literature has emerged on the opportunities and challenges of this policy.  However, none of the papers have taken up an inter country comparison of the  issue in detail. This paper attempts at studying the economic effect of &lsquo;FDI in  retail&rsquo; on various sectors of the economy drawing the cues from the experiences  of other nations. The paper is divided in six sections. Section I gives an  overview of the present state of the Indian retail industry. Section II  explains the proposed &lsquo;FDI in retail&rsquo; policy in detail. Section III will  discuss the experience of other nations with respect to allowing FDI in the  retail sector. Section IV discusses the million dollar question that &lsquo;Is FDI in  retail more bad than good for India?&rsquo; This section will take a look at various  benefits and costs attached to the policy building upon the lessons learned  from the experience of other nations. Section V will talk about the  recommendations and concludes the paper. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">II.  Indian Retail Sector, Opportunities Untapped <u> </u></p>
<p>Retailing in  India is slightly different from that in the developed nations, in that it is  divided in organized and unorganized sectors. Organized retail is described as  the one where trading is taking place under a license or through the people who  are registered under sales tax or income tax. On the other hand, the  unorganized sector in India is more traditional style which includes the local  mom and pop stores (<em>kirana stores)</em>,  owner managed general stores, paan/beedi shops, convenience stores, hand carts  and street vendors. The organized retail in India accounts for a mere 4%of the  total market (2008) while in China it is 20% and 40% in Thailand. This presents  a clear indication that the organized retail sector in India has immense  untapped opportunities. </p>
<p>A.T. Kearney&rsquo;s  study on global retailing trends in the world found that India is least  saturated and least competitive of all major global economies. A. T. Kearney  prepares a Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) annually, in which in ranks  the top 30 emerging economies for retail development and identifies the opportunities  presented by these countries for the global retailers. In the 2011 GRDI  tabulation, India ranks as the fourth hottest market for retail development,  leaving behind China. The Global Retail Development Index details are presented  in table I.</p>

  <em>Source:  A.T. Kearney&rsquo;s Global Retail Development Index 2011 </em></p>
<p>The small share  of Indian organized retail in the total market share makes it quite vulnerable.  The competition is less and so are the barriers to enter for players trying to  setup base in India. A.T. Kearney&rsquo;s 2011 report states that global retailers  such as Walmart, Carrefour, Tesco and Casino would take advantage of the more  favorable FDI rules that are likely in India and enter the country through the  partnerships with local retailers. It further states that a good talent pool,  unlimited opportunities, huge markets and availability of quality raw materials  at cheaper costs is expected to make India overtake the world&rsquo;s best retail  economies by 2042, according to industry players. In table A, it is evident  that the urgency to enter the Indian market for the global players is 100%,  making the case for the entry of FDI in the sector.</p>
<p>The Indian  retailer sector is divided in three segments, &lsquo;single brand retail&rsquo;, &lsquo;multi  brand retail&rsquo; and &lsquo;cash and carry&rsquo; which refer to wholesale retail. In 1997, FDI in cash and carry (wholesale)  with 100 percent ownership was allowed under the Government approval route. It  was brought under the automatic route in 2006. Wal -mart has already  entered this market with a joint venture with Bharti. 100% foreign investment in single brand retailing and 51% FDI in multi  brand retailing are permitted in 2012. The organized retail sector in  India is at its nascent stage. There are department stores like Shopper&rsquo;s Stop,  Ebony, Piramyd and Globus, Supermarkets like Subhiksha, Vitan, Food World and  the own brand store like Pantaloon. But unfortunately, the Indian Supermarket  experience has not been so pleasant. The retail chains buy only &lsquo;A&rsquo; grade  produce and that to only a part of it. Farmers have to approach mandis for the  sale of rest of the produce. Recent studies reveal that these chains led to no  improvement in the supply chain efficiency and buy from a few resourceful  contract farmers without any promise or contract to buy regularly. These stores  have miserable performance e.g. Subhiksha, More, Spencer&rsquo;s. Bangalore has  highest supermarket penetration and the kirana stores have suffered badly. In  the present scenario the supermarkets have only informal arrangements with  growers instead of contract farming. The supermarkets are unwilling to share  the risk of the growers. They give the market-price based prices to the farmers  who have to bear the risk of price fall in the market (Singh, Sukhpal 2010). </p>
<p>The capital  infusion and improvement of the supply chain can boost the performance of these  supermarkets and hypermarkets. Moreover, the nascent stage of organized retail  sector in India makes it the premier choice for investment by foreign players. </p>
<p align="center">III.  Foreign Direct Investment In Indian Retail  Sector, The Road Ahead<br>
  <u> </u><br>
  The Indian  Government has opened up the retail sector for foreign players given that it is  bursting with opportunities to explore. Though there is 100% FDI permitted in  the cold chain sector but FDI opening in single and multi brand retailing is  expected to yield much better results. Moreover, there is less consolidation in  retail sector, weaker competition and an ever growing middle class with a large  appetite for consumer goods and services. The current FDI in retail policy of  Indian Government is being discussed below</p>
<ul>
  <li>51% FDI permitted in the multi brand  retailing. The unbranded products are allowed for agricultural produce like  fruits, vegetables, flowers, grain, pulses, fish and meat.</li>
  <li>Minimum investment to be brought in, as  FDI, by the foreign investor would be US $100 million.</li>
  <li>FDI is not likely under the automatic  route implying that FIPB approval is needed on case by case basis.</li>
  <li>50% investment should be done at  improving the back-end infrastructure. Back-end infrastructure will include  investment made towards processing, manufacturing, distribution, design  improvement, quality control, packaging, logistics, storage, ware-house,  agriculture market produce infrastructure etc.</li>
  <li>30% of the raw materials should be  procured from small and medium enterprises (SMEs). </li>
  <li>Permission to set up stores only in  cities with a minimum population of 1 million which is 53 cities in India  according to 2011 census. </li>
  <li>Government has the first right to  procure materials from the farmers.</li>
  <li>While the proposals for FDI will be  sanctioned by the Centre, approvals from each State Government will be  required. </li>
  <li>Retail trading, in any form, by means of  e-commerce, would not be permitted, for companies with FDI, engaged in the  activity of multi brand retailing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The criticism on  the policy is pervasive. It is expected to make the situation worse for  farmers, small agricultural intermediaries, mom and pop stores, small  manufacturers and the consumers at large by raising food inflation. It is  anticipated to be recolonization in the post independence era. But the  proponents of the policy term this protest a dialectic one. There has always  been agitation and resistance when the economy changes its paradigm. Karl Marx  called it dialectical materialism and so has been observed in the case of this  policy. The Government is supporting the FDI in retail on the premise that it  will create jobs, the prices will come down, the supply chain will see a  massive investment and improvement and the suppliers will improve due to  tougher competition. </p>
<p>To understand  the implication of FDI in retail in the Indian market, this paper studies the  experience of other nation on the same front. The positive impact of organized  retailing could be seen in USA, UK, and Mexico and also in China. It is also  important to understand that Argentina, China, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia,  Malaysia, Russia, Singapore and Thailand have allowed 100% FDI in multi brand  retail. These countries benefited immensely from it. Also small retailers  co-exist. The quality of the services has also increased. The next section  takes into account the experience of following countries to draw some lessons  for India:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Malaysia, to study the impact on  retailers and consumers;</li>
  <li>China, to study the effect on the  economic growth at large;</li>
  <li>Mexico, to study the plight of small  producers post opening of FDI;</li>
  <li>Romania, to take into account the effect  on the total factor productivity of the supplying industries;</li>
  <li>Thailand, to study the effect of big  retailers on small retailers;</li>
  <li>South Africa to look at the impact on  the employment level of the nation; and</li>
  <li>Russia to study the impact of FDI in  retail on the supply chain management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><br>
  IV.  Case of Mexico<br>
  <br>
  Is Walmart modernizing retail at a price of  creating a captive supply base? Walmart entered Mexico in 1991 and by 1997  Walmart took major control of the Mexico retail sector by becoming Walmex. The  paper being reviewed in this section is the 2009 version of a study by World  Bank, University of Oxford, University of Colorado, NBER, CEPR and Penn State  University. The study has focused on the impact of the entry of giant retailer  Walmart on the innovation and industry productivity of the Mexican economy. The  major stakeholder emerging with the entry of a big retailer in the market is  the small producer or supplier. The growing dominance of Walmart on Mexico led  to two phenomenal changes in the economy: modernization of warehousing,  distribution and inventory management and it changed the way it interacted with  the suppliers. </p>
<p><em>A.  Modernization of supply chain</em><br>
  Walmart opened the Mexican  economy to larger markets, both nationally and in terms in increasing export  opportunities. Overall the retail industry saw a rise in the productivity. The  innovations imported from US by Walmart have helped Mexico modernize its supply  chain. The warehousing, distribution and inventory management sectors have  witnessed growth post retail liberalization. Since 1997, a severe decrease in  the purchases/sales ratio has been observed especially in the case of Walmart.  An explanation for this could be the reorganization of the supply chain. By  increasing their centralized-distribution capacities, retailers may have  internalized one part of the distribution service that is no more paid to suppliers.  In 1999, 80 % of the products sold in Wal-Mart stores were distributed by its  own distribution centers when at the same time that was only the case for 13%  of Gigante&rsquo;s products and less than 20% of Commercial Mexicana&rsquo;s. </p>
<p><em>B.  Creating a captive supply base</em><br>
  On one hand, Walmart has  modernized the Mexican retail sector while on the other it has clearly imposed  a tight squeeze on domestic retailers through its extraordinary bargaining  powers. Walmart continually demands its suppliers to improve quality of the  product and lower price and sometimes the combination of both. Walmart enters  in an agreement with its suppliers which requires regular R&amp;D operations to  upgrade the technology. Moreover, it has been observed by the researchers that  Walmart demand a logistics discount from the suppliers on the grounds of  reduced distribution costs. These factors collectively have reduced the mark up  of the suppliers. The pricing decisions are more or less driven by Walmart and  the squeeze is real and quantitatively very important as observed by the  authors of the referred paper. The growing market power of buyers (WalMart and  Sinergia) increases the cross regional competition, requires a minimum provider  scale and tends to deteriorate the capacity of providers&rsquo; negotiation who have  to accept very unfavorable prices or payment conditions. For example, Wal-Mart  is used to pay its providers at a 120 days term but also to ask them to give  for free an initial stock when Wal-Mart opens a new store (Durand, 2005).  Global retailers have the option of importing goods than purchasing locally  which increases their bargaining power. In 2003 Wal-Mart was not only number 6  on the list of the main importers in Mexico given by Expansión but also the  greatest contributor to the Mexican commercial deficit. It has been observed  since 1997 that a process of intensification of imports in absolute and  relative terms by modern retailers as well as Wal-Mart&rsquo;s has proportionally a  higher share of imports  than the local  firms. This growing pressure of imports due to the increasing global sourcing  of modern retailers is one of the most relevant consequences of FDI for local  suppliers (Durand, 2005). Exit of low appeal product suppliers has been  observed and the medium appeal product suppliers get quality adjusted price  which lowers their mark up to exceptionally low levels. </p>
<p><em>C.  Opportunities explored for domestic suppliers</em><br>
  The entry of  Walmart in Mexico has been a mixed blessing. Walmart has provided the domestic  suppliers with a wider market both nationally and across borders which made  them shift towards Walmart from the local retailers. The suppliers have emerged  as national suppliers, supplying under the Walmart brand or under their own  brand in some cases. The technology upgradation and innovations has been a  route to suppliers to escape the mandatory price cuts which Walmart demands.  For instance, Mexican-owned detergent producers have reported introducing  incremental improvements to their products in order to avoid drastic price cuts  demanded by Wal-Mart (Javorcik et al. 2006). There has been a positive impact  on the productivity of high appeal products and on the wages of the workers in  the top establishments. </p>
<p>The Mexican  experience has been studied only from the perspective of Walmart&rsquo;s entry but it  has helped understand the dynamics behind entry of big retailers, especially  the impact on domestic supplying industry. The suppliers face a tough tradeoff,  increase in market size and export opportunities being offered versus the low  mark up and high innovation cost regime imposed by Walmart! The growing  pressure of imports and the increasing power of big retailers are expected to  lead to elimination of some local providers and a concentration process in the  supply chains with a risk of miserable growth for the surviving firms. </p>
<p align="center">V. Case of Malaysia:  Different Retailers affected differently and Consumers becoming cosmopolitan</p>
<p>The paper being  reviewed in this section studies the impact of &lsquo;FDI in retail&rsquo; on local  retailers in Klang Valley, Malaysia (2008). The case of Malaysia presents an  interesting insight. There is a widespread belief that different types of  retail businesses will be affected differently by the presence of the large  scale retail outlets (Stone, 1988, 1995 and 1997; Peterson and McGee, 2000;  Brennan and Lundsten, 2000; Artz and Stone 2006). The Malaysian case confirms  with the study of Stone. The study done by the authors suggested that the  retailers selling complementary goods in relation to the products offered by  international retailers, benefitted from their entry in the economy and they  favoured their location near their business area as it will attract more  customers to the area. On the other hand, the retailers offering similar  products were against the location of these big stores near their business  areas. It has been observed that there is a strong link between the entry of  big retailers and the deterioration of the local businesses. </p>
<p>Retail sector of  Malaysia was characterized by large number of small stores offering only  limited variety of goods and services. As retail sector went under rapid  transformation with liberalization of FDI, the small traditional shops were  complemented by large departmental stores and supermarkets offering a wide  range of merchandise and services. The entry of foreign players benefitted the  economy at large and the consumers became more affluent and mobile. Malaysian  consumer lifestyle has been evolving and changing due, in part, to rising  affluence and education. High profile international retailers and the global  mass media has also played a role in changing consumer shopping pattern. They  are becoming more affluent and cosmopolitan. They have moved from a simple need  of sustenance to key leisure items like health, beauty, lifestyle and fitness.  Impressive growth has been observed in the economy attracting major  international retailers like Makro, Carrefour, Tesco, Giant, Jaya Jusco, Courts  Mammoth etc into the economy (Kaliappan, Alavi, Abdullah, Zakaullah, 2008)</p>
<p align="center">VI.  Case of Romania: Enhanced Total Factor  Productivity of the Suppliers<br>
  <br>
  The expansion of  global retail chains in Romania has led to a significant increase in the total  factor productivity of the supplying firms. It has been observed that their  presence in a region increases the total factor productivity of firms by 15.2  percent and doubling the number of chains leads to a 10.8 percent increase in  total factor productivity. However, the expansion benefits larger firms the  most and has a much smaller impact on small enterprises (Javorcik, Li). The  local firms and producers benefitted from the knowledge spillover from the big  retailers. Swinnen (2006) documented a detailed picture of how FDI in retail  sector in some Central and Eastern European countries led to a productivity  growth of the local diary farmers. </p>
<p>The best  international practices and the advanced retail technologies of the global  chains helped the domestic firms to lower their costs. The computerized  inventory systems being used by global chains made the suppliers better informed  about the demand levels in the market. For instance, Wal-Mart provides its  suppliers with full and free access to real-time data on how their products are  selling. Suppliers can plan production runs earlier and offer better prices  (Economist 2001). Tesco tracks every purchase through its Club card and can use  this information to help its private-label suppliers to test and adapt  innovations (The Boston Consulting Group 2007).</p>
<p align="center">VII.  Case of Russia<u> </u></p>
<p><em>A.   FDI modernizing the supply chain  management</em><br>
  Russia  represents one of the fastest growing economies in the Central and Eastern  Europe. The supermarket revolution in Russia occurred in the 2000s. In 2002,  sales by the top-15 chains totaled US$2.7 billion; by 2006, sales by those  chains had soared to US$19.2 billion. The share of the top-3 chains was 40 per  cent in 2002 and 54 per cent in 2006, with the lead domestic chains acquiring  many small regional and local chains. The foreign share of sales was 33 per  cent in 2002 and 35 per cent in 2006-only inching up and spreading over 8  foreign chains among the top 15 (Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion  (DIPP), 2010). The supply chain in Russian retail sector consists of the  agricultural producers, followed by the food processing industries and the retailers  and wholesalers and then the product reaches the consumer for final  consumption. The foreign direct investment in Russia&rsquo;s retail sector has had an  influence at all the management levels of the supply chain. The food processing  industry has international players like Danone, Mars, Campina etc. The retail  trade has Metro (cash and carry) and Auchan (hypermarkets) as the international  retailers. Auchan established itself in Russia as an international retailer in  the year 2002 and it ranked fourth in the top 10 food retailers in Russia  according to 2007 survey with an annual turnover of $3400 million (Belaya,  Hanf, 2009).</p>
<p><em>B.  Agricultural Production</em><br>
  As has been  observed in the case of Walmex, the international retailers are rigid in terms  of regular quality upgradation and price reductions. The standards required by  the suppliers are thus acting as an incentive for them to work towards  innovation and upgradation. Agricultural producers have to comply by the new  standards of the international retailers in order to stay in the supply chain. <br>
  There is a  growing interaction between the farmers and the foreign processors and  retailers which change their old techniques and make them accustomed to the new  and improved business practices. </p>
<p><em>C.  Food Processing and retail trade</em><br>
  The foreign retailers and  processors impose all elements of the Western supply and quality chain  management in Russian retail sector. The foreign food processors have even  established plants in Russia to produce the international brands and the  retailers&rsquo; own brands. This is what actually the proponents of FDI in retail  claim that allowing foreign players in the retailing sector attracts them to  improve the supply chain in the nation too. For instance, FDI in cold chain is  allowed to 100% through automatic route but it is not significant in the  absence of retailing.</p>
<p align="center">VIII.  China Witnessing Growth, Thailand and South  Africa Tackling Job Losses<u> </u></p>
<p>The retail trade  in China has been growing since 1992. The foreign ownership restrictions have  been progressively lifted and following the China&rsquo;s accession to WTO, effective  December 2004, there are no equity restrictions. Over 600 hypermarkets were  opened between 1996 and 2001. The number of small outlets (equivalent to <em>kirana</em>s) increased from 1.9 million to  over 2.5 million. Employment in the retail and wholesale sector increased from  28 million people to 54 million people between 1992 and 2001. China has  registered impressive growth by the entry of the foreign players. The organized  retail has led to robust economic growth and the growing incomes of the rural  and urban sectors have raised the consumption levels. This creates an  environment which is conducive for the further growth of retail trade. (DIPP,  2010)</p>
<p>Thailand is  known as a country where the local retailers suffered immensely because of the  entry of the foreign players. Prior to 1997, no foreign investment was allowed  and small family owned stores dominated the Thai market. After the Asian crisis  of 1997, it permitted the foreign capital in retail. Currently, there is 100%  foreign equity allowed with no limit on the number of outlets. As the economy  was already recovering from a recession when the foreign players entered, the  local retailers got very easily marginalized. The international retailers  expanded their operations significantly and the local players were forced to  shut down their business (ICRIER, 2008). The entry affected all segments of the  market – wholesalers, manufactures and the domestic retailers. On the other  hand, the agro processing industry of Thailand witnessed growth and foreign  retailers created networks for the exports of the Thai made goods. FDI in  retail developed the organized retailing in Thailand but at a price of the  demise of a large chunk of local retailers. </p>
<p>UNI Global Union  along with its South African affiliate, The South African Allied Commercial,  Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU) have highlighted the poor impact of  FDI in retail on the employment levels of South Africa, focusing primarily on  the effect of Walmart. Walmart&rsquo;s entry in South Africa has resulted in  significant job losses in the retail sector. The Walmart&rsquo;s poor record in  labour relations and protection of workers has been a major reason for its  opposition. Bones Skulu, General Secretary, SACCAWU said, &ldquo;India should beware  of Walmartisation. Over the winter we saw South African supermarket chain Pick  n Pay cut more than 3000 jobs as it prepares to compete with Walmart Protection  of workers in the supply chain is also of paramount importance. This is one of  the issues we have vigorously brought to the attention of the South African  government and the decision is now being reviewed in the courts.&rdquo; (Elliott, UNI  Global Union, Shekhar, Unitespro)</p>
<p align="center">IX.  FDI In Indian Retail Sector, More Bad then  Good<br>
  <u> </u><br>
  <em>A.  Employment effects</em><br>
  The concerns  about the plight of Indian retail, after opening up of FDI, are numerous. The  first concern been discussed in this paper is regarding the employment levels  of the country. Following agriculture, in 2007-2008, the retail sector is the  second largest employer in India (National Sample Survey Organization, 64th  round). Retail trade employed 7.2% of the total workforce which translates to  33.1 million jobs (DIPP Report, 2010). The share of retail workforce has  increased since 1993-94. The pattern holds for both males and females, in rural  and urban areas. In table II, each cell represents the average percent of the  retail sector in total employment over the given time period. </p>
<p>TABLE II                         EMPLOYMENT SHARES IN RETAIL TRADE,  1993-2008<br>
  <img src="Foreign_Direct_Investment_clip_image006.gif" alt="Foreign Direct Investment In Indian Retail Sector" width="336" height="59"> <br>
  <em>Source: Chari, Raghavan (2011)</em><br>
  Given that  retail sector forms such an important absorber of the workforce, the entry of  big retailers can by no means be ignored to have an impact on the employment  level. Using the county-level data, a recent study finds that Wal-Mart entry  increases retail employment in the year of entry (Basker, 2005a) while  contrasting evidence indicates that each Wal-Mart worker replaces approximately  1.4 retail workers representing a 2.7 percent reduction in average retail  employment (Neumark, Zhang and Ciccarella, 2008). The effect of Walmart&rsquo;s entry  on the South Africa&rsquo;s employment level has already been stressed upon in the  last section. </p>
<p>However, the  discussion paper released by DIPP recommends to reserve 50% jobs in FDI funded  retail outlets for the rural youth. The implementation of such policy is of  major debate. The point to note is that these FDI funded retail outlets are to  be established only in major cities with a population of above 1 million (52  cities in India according to 2011 census) and not in rural areas. So, the  employment issue directly concerns the semi-skilled self employed youth of  these cities. The rural youth will be affected only indirectly by the effect on  agricultural intermediaries.  In an  economy, where 80% of the population engaged in trade and local retailing is  self employed, how do the numbers stack up if you dislodge even 20% of that  population? Even after more than 60 years of independence, India is marred by  the issue of employment. For the Government that is unable to provide enough  employment opportunities in the big cities, the impact on smaller ones will be  unmanageable. </p>
<p><em>B.  Local retailers having tough competition ahead</em><br>
  Apart from the  employment level of the economy, the individual effect on the domestic retailer  is important to look at. Given the case of Thailand and Malaysia in hand, the  retailers and their prospective plight can&rsquo;t be ignored. The proponents of FDI  in retail argue that the effect of international retailers on the small  retailers depend on a lot of factors like the type of business conducted by the  local retailers (those which the selling the different product will be  positively affected), the proximity of the existing business and the new  stores, the size and the competitiveness of local businesses, and whether the  new businesses will try to improve their business practices. This validity of  this idea has been observed in the case of Malaysia. However, Thailand presents  us with a different lesson. A reason for such wipe out of Thailand&rsquo;s local  retailers could be the timing of the introduction of FDI in the economy. As  Thailand&rsquo;s economy was already recovering from the Asian crisis when  international retailers entered, it became all the more difficult for the local  retailers to evolve.</p>
<p> The Malaysian economy has cleverly put up  safeguards to protect their local retailers which Indian economy needs to learn  from. For instance, since December 2004 Malaysian Government local authorities  conduct a socio-economic impact study before any application for hypermarket,  department stores, speciality stores or superstores can be considered.  Moreover, foreign investment is restricted in certain retail formats like mini  market (less than 400sq m), supermarket (between 400 and 2000 sq m), provision  shop/ general vendor, 24 hours convenience store, medical hall, petrol kiosk  with or without convenience store, permanent wet market and permanent pavement  store.  Such safeguards have helped protect  the Malaysian retailers. Indonesia has to impose stringent zoning policy to  restrict the growth of supermarkets and help the local retailers. The zoning  policy is not even mentioned in the discussion paper issued by DIPP. </p>
<p>Even after  sufficient safeguards, the small retailers are bound to suffer. Small retail  has been virtually wiped out of the developed countries like the US and in  Europe. The big retailers change the playing field permanently to make it  impossible for small retailers to co-exist. Big retail is habit altering. It  will make the shopping a weekend activity, and the <em>kirana</em> stores will bear the brunt. Walmart will sustain losses to  counter Carrefour and a Carrefour will do the same to contain another  competitor. In a fight of such giants, the small retailer and the&nbsp;<em>kirana</em>&nbsp;shop  owner of today stand no chance. Supermarkets tend to alter the prices across  branches called price flexing as observed by the UK Competition Commission  working to the disadvantage of local mom and pop stores. </p>
<p>The positive  impact of large-scale foreign retailers on local retailers is largely in the  form of the introduction of new retail channels or modern outlets, the  introduction of new marketing and merchandising methods, improved information  management methods, and larger investment in the modernization of the sector as  a whole (Dawson, 2003). Global retail chains differ from indeginous retailers  not only in terms of scale but also in their access to advanced technology,  modern management strategies and global sourcing networks. It seems that though  the big retailers come with a plethora of advantages for local retailers and  have spillover effects as been studied by various research papers, but at the  same time the experience of different nations can&rsquo;t be ignored. The experience  of Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and even the developed countries like US  indicate that the small retailers are bound to suffer by the entry of big  giants but the effect could be reduced to some extent by putting proper  safeguards in place. </p>
<p><em>C.  Local manufacturers losing bargaining power</em><br>
  The cases of  Mexico and Romania draw our attention to an important stakeholder – the  domestic supplier/ producer. The Indian Government and the proponents of FDI in  retail suggests that supplying industries will benefit by lower distribution  costs, stimulating economies of scale and increasing competition. This in turn  is expected to increase innovation and productivity. There is ample of  international experience on these grounds to draw some conclusions for India.  The local retailers of Romania experienced an increase in the total factor  productivity. The case of China provides with an example where local producers&rsquo;  export capabilities increased because of the presence of multinational  retailers. This may hold true for certain preferred suppliers but overall this  is not the expected scenario. </p>
<p>Supermarkets  have multiple channels through the sys­tem of category management, and suppli­ers  range from spot markets, or traditional wholesalers, to preferred suppliers and  direct contracts with independent large growers, with the latter two increasing  in importance. For example: Carrefour, Malaysia&rsquo;s fresh fruit and vegetable  supply chain was made up of wholesalers (41% of total supplies), semi-direct  suppliers (wholesalers and sup­pliers) (41%), and direct suppliers (18%).  Similarly, GIANT, another supermarket in Malaysia, which in 2002 had 200  vegetable suppliers, reduced them to only 30 in 2004 which included specialised  wholesalers, general wholesalers, farmers with oral con­tracts, and suppliers  without contracts. Similar was the case of TOPS in Thailand which had 250  suppliers to begin with (Chen et al 2005). This is known as &ldquo;supplier ra­tionalisation&rdquo;  in supermarket terminology. This practice will seriously affect the local  producers of the economy. </p>
<p>Apart from the  rationalization of the suppliers, the price paid to the suppliers forms another  issue. Favouring FDI on the grounds of lower distribution costs will actually  be a product of short-sightedness of the policymakers. The case of Mexico is a  perfect example where the entry of Walmart has converted the suppliers to more  or less a captive supply base. They are required to provide regular discounts,  enhance quality, invest in R&amp;D or else exit! There is lowered markup for  the suppliers and exit of low appeal product producer. Similar has been the  case of UK, where a negative relation be­tween the relative market share of a  super­market and price paid to the suppliers in relation to the average price  has been observed. The larger the market share of a supermarket, the lower was  the price paid to the suppliers. The UK supermarket chain Tesco paid its  suppliers a price 4% below the average price paid by retailers due to its  buying power (Stichele et al 2006). This lower producer price does not necessarily  result in lower consumer price (Durand 2007).</p>
<p><em>D.  Supply chain management: effects on food inflation and agricultural  intermediaries</em><br>
  The impact of  FDI on the supply chain management is also being debated. Though FDI in cold  chain is allowed to 100% through automatic route but it is not significant in  the absence of FDI in retailing. India is the second largest producer of fruits  and vegetables (about 180 million MT), but it has a very limited integrated  cold-chain infrastructure, with only 5386 stand-alone cold storages, having a  total capacity of 23.6 million MT, 80% of this&nbsp; is used only for  potatoes.&nbsp;The chain is highly fragmented and hence, perishable  horticultural commodities find it difficult to link to distant markets,  including overseas markets, round the year.&nbsp;The case of Russia presents us  with an example where the supply chain management has improved with increased  FDI in retail. The agricultural production, food processing industry and retail  trade of food products have shown upgradation and better management in Russia  post liberalization in retail. In the case of India, improving the supply chain  is expected to reduce number of agricultural intermediaries and reduce the food  inflation. The two issues are discussed below in detail.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;farm-to-store&rsquo;  supply chain is considered to be myth by those who oppose FDI. The number of  agricultural intermediaries will be reduced, but they are expected to be  replaced by bigger, more organized, more prosperous middlemen. Direct sale from  farmer to retailer is only a possibility if the farm is retailer owned. The  transporter and distributor to the supplier are required for every transaction  between farmer and store. The big retailers will have their own middlemen and  the present middlemen will suffer.</p>
<p>The food  inflation is also suggested to lower after the supply chain efficiency. But  food inflation has to do with supply side shortages and distribution  bottlenecks that have mostly to do with government policy in each case and FDI  in retail has nothing to do with it. Inflation is a politically sensitive  subject, particularly for incumbent governments in a democratic country such as  India, in particular because rising food prices tend to be regressive in their  impact. This is underscored by the fact that the weight of food in rural and  agricultural household consumption baskets is approximately 65-70% (Chari,  Raghavan, 2011). FDI was introduced in agriculture in 2006 and according to  Congress MP Jyoti Mridha, it is yet to show any progress. In such a scenario, FDI  in retail cannot be expected to reap benefits. To qualify that consumers do not  get better prices, read this comment from a KPMG expert who was arguing for FDI  in retail:&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;To draw consumers, [big] retailers squeeze suppliers  and ensure efficiencies in categories that drive foot falls. They balance it  out by enjoying higher margins in categories where impulse buying is high&rdquo;  &nbsp;</em>[Anand&nbsp; Ramanathan quoted in Economic Times,1st&nbsp;Dec 2011]. </p>
<p align="center">X.  Recommendations and Conclusions</p>
<p>Though Indian  Government has opened up multi brand retailing for foreign direct investment,  but there are various concerns too. The first concern discussed in this paper  is the employment issue from the economy&rsquo;s point of view. The other concerns  being raised in this paper include the expected plight of local retailers and  suppliers after coming up of international retailers in the country. The supply  chain management is also anticipated to be affected in a large way and it has  been discussed in the paper. There are various papers which discuss the  prospective opportunities and costs attached to the entry of international  retailers in India. This paper goes further and attempts an inter country  comparison of the situation to identify the probable impact areas. An analysis  of the experience of seven countries (Malaysia, China, Mexico, Thailand, South  Africa, Romania and Russia) has been done and the impact on various sectors has  been discussed like the local retail market, local manufacturers, employment  rate, supply chain management, consumers and the economic growth of the nation. </p>
<p>The entry of FDI  in multi brand retail in India can be growth enhancing only if proper  safeguards are in place and the market environment is regulated. Firstly, the  resources should be dedicated for a comprehensive study of retail and its  related industries. Secondly, the number of big retail outlets in a particular  city should be decided on the basis of population criterion and the employment  level of local youth in the retail business. Thirdly, the format of these  retail chains should also be regulated as is done in Malaysian case. They  should not be in the form of neighborhood convenience store and there should be  minimum and maximum limit of the size of these stores. Fourthly, it is  important to ensure that no single retailer monopolizes the procurement  operations in an area, district or state in order to protect the local  suppliers. Lastly, the predatory pricing and the anticompetitive practices of  these international retailers should be prohibited in order to create a playing  field for local retailers. </p>
