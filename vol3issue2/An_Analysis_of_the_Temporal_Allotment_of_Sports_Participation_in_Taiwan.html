<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Sport is one of the most popular leisure activities of all time. The purposes of this study were to 1) deduce the basic modes of the average Taiwanese person’s sports participation; 2) probe into their schemas of temporal allotment, and 3) analyse the influential factors in their decision-making. It is hoped that this study can provide an internal variability model for observing the overall sports participation in Taiwan. The questionnaire subject pool included 5,102 Taiwanese retrieved from “The Survey of Social Development Trends (Time Use), Taiwan Area, ROC”, on five variables (age, education, occupation, holiday situation and personal income) and two intervening variables (pleasantness perception and time perception) from “The Cognition and Perception of Time” Scale. Descriptive statistics, categorical multiple regression analysis and path analysis were used to construct the sports participation internal model. The results are as follows: 1) the older the participants were in age, the more persistent their sports participation would appear to be. However, the higher their educational backgrounds were, the less enthusiastic they seemed to be about participating in sports. Workers and students had less sports participation, but the retired, the stay-at-home and the unemployed demonstrated real ardour for sports. Except for the group of unemployed as their holiday status and a personal income of less than 6,668 USD per year, the other factors had no significant influence on sports participation; 2) multiple regression with categorical variables: sport participation =.270 × age + .149 × occupation + .071 ×  holiday + .064 × education + .062 × time + .036 × income -.052 × pleasant; and 3) path analysis indicated that the model of sports participation was acceptable (χ2=463.45(p=.00), RMSEA=.134, GFI=.978, AGFI=.840, CFI=.973, NFI=.973, NNFI=.849, CN=159.411).</p>

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <h2>Interest in sports participation  behaviour </h2>
  <p>In 1977, the issue of sports participation behaviour  was fore-grounded in the Council of Europe. Rodgers (1977) grounded his opinion  upon some observations that sports participation behaviours shared an almost  identical mode in different European countries, especially in those countries  where it plummeted in popularity among the elderly, and the male participants  in sports amounted to almost double the number of women. Kamphorst and Roberts  (1989) attempted to establish a comparison of 15 countries according to their  sport participation behaviour, including the United States, Canada and eight  European countries. Their study reached some very similar conclusions. <br>
    Since then, an increasing number of scholars have  studied the subject of sports participation behaviour. In these studies, based  on an analysis of demographic variables, firstly, some of the research shows  that age and sports participation have a linear negative correlation (Serrano,  1999), while other studies have shown a non-linear negative correlation or  non-significant correlation (Brooks, 1988). Downward (2004) indicated that  sports participation behaviour would rise with age, stagnate in marriage and  even plummet to inertia as the number of children rose. Gratton and Taylor  (2000) further found that age was a negative factor in sports participation  decision-making. Secondly, education was found to have a positive correlation  with sports participation (Andreff &amp; Nys, 2001). Thirdly, personal income  was also found to have a positive correlation with sports participation (Sport  England, 2004), but Brooks (1988) found that it had no significant correlation.  Fourthly, as regards participants&rsquo; occupations, Gratton and Taylor (2000) pointed out  that leisure time (non-employed or retired) had a positive influence on one&rsquo;s sports  participation, and the style of occupation had a close relationship with the  quantity of one&rsquo;s leisure time. Lastly, almost all the socio-economic  co-ordinates upheld sports participation in the recent studies, such as types  of work, income or educational level (Gratton &amp; Tice, 1991; Downward,  2004). Most research on sports participation behaviour has surveyed the  spectrum of temporal allotment to verify statements including demographic or  socio-economic characteristic variables. In consequence, the sports behaviour  of Taiwanese is our major concern in this study. </p>
  <h2>Temporal allotment in Taiwan</h2>
  <p>A recent nationwide survey of temporal allotment in  the Taiwan area was conducted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting  and Statistics (DGBAS), Executive Yuan, ROC (Taiwan). It measured the amount of  time people spend doing various activities, and divided the 24 hours of a day  into three parts, i.e., &ldquo;necessary time&rdquo;, &ldquo;constraint  time&rdquo; and &ldquo;free time. &ldquo;Necessary time&rdquo; meant the minimum of  time spent sustaining life, such as sleeping and having meals. &rdquo;Constraint  time&rdquo; was to meet the assorted needs of living, such as  working, schooling and household duties. &ldquo;Free time&rdquo; was one&rsquo;s leisure  time, available for an assortment of pastimes, self-training or entertainment.  Exercise was one of the twenty options for &ldquo;free time&rdquo; in the  survey. The DGBAS arranged exercise under the category of &ldquo;health and  leisure&rdquo;, which clearly defined its attributes in the temporal  allotment survey.<br>
    The quantity of time spent on sport was one of the  costs that came along with the benefits. This quantitative measurement also helped fathom  enthusiasm for exercise. Although it cannot totally stand for the benefit that  participants obtain from exercise, time spent on exercise is worth studying. We  analysed the DGBAS survey of temporal allotment in Taiwan over twenty years,  and found that the average of sports participation for all people in Taiwan  amounted to 14 minutes per day in 1987, 13 minutes in 1990, 19 minutes in 2000,  and 21 minutes in 2004 (DGBAS, Executive Yuan, 1987, 1990, 2000, 2004). Sports  participation presents a soaring trend that is relevant to other indicators of  living standards, such as GDP, economic growth rate, personal income and so on.  Sports participation rose together with economic development. We could  therefore regard sports participation as one of the effective indicators of  benefits that arise from a regular habit of exercise. <br>
    The variables of sports participation were made with  reference to &ldquo;Basic Background Factors in the Model Underlying  Activity Participation (p17)&rdquo; in &ldquo;Time for Life&rdquo; (Robinson &amp; Godbey, 1997). They are divided into  biological, role, status, ecological and temporal factors in the model presented  in the book. There are three variables in the biological factors, including  gender, age and race. For the role factors, work hours, marriage and number of  children constitute the list, while education, income and occupation make up  the status factors. The ecological factors include the urban/suburban dichotomy  and housing type. Finally, durations measured as weeks, seasons and years  constitute the temporal factors. The aforesaid 15 variables were counted as the  five overall factors.</p>
  <h1>METHOD </h1>
  <h2>Social Development  Trends Survey </h2>
  <p>Along with the rapid change in social and economic situations, the  Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Taiwan (ROC)  initiated the &ldquo;Social Development Trends Survey&rdquo; in 1998 to gather basic  information on social development and people&rsquo;s lifestyles, and hopefully to  thoroughly investigate the core social issues. The goal is to grasp the trend  of social development from a regular, systematic survey, which is comprised of  four facets: family life, social participation, temporal allotment, and health  and security. Each subject will be investigated every four years alternately. </p>
  <h2><strong> </strong>Subjects</h2>
  <p>The &ldquo;Social Development Trends Survey&rdquo; adopts the &ldquo;stratified random  sampling method&rdquo;, firstly stratifying its target sample unit of village, and  then narrowing down to the second sample unit of family. The survey was  conducted in 524 villages and with 11,000 families, creating a database that  contained a total of 14,017 samples. In this study we chose to analyse 5,102  people who participate in sports and spend time on sports. </p>
  <h2>Survey Method </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The &ldquo;Social Development Trends Survey&rdquo; adopted &ldquo;the  method of time use&rdquo; (Kao, 2000) to record one&rsquo;s daily activities, including  necessary time (sleep, meals, hand and face washing, taking a shower, getting  dressed, etc.), constraint time (working, schooling, traffic, household chores,  shopping, etc.) and free time (self-education, tutorial lessons, doing  homework, watching television, reading newspapers, magazines, exercising,  etc.). There were 29 items in total, with 15 minutes for each time zone. The  subjects were required to remember the activities performed on the previous day  and to record them for each time zone. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Two factors: Time Perception and Pleasantness Perception </h2>
  <p>The DGBAS surveyed the  &ldquo;cognition and feel of time&rdquo; scale in particular; providing eight items in  total on a 5-point Likert scale. This study divided them into positive and  negative cognitions, the former including activeness in time, optimism for  time, time use and allocation appropriate to one&rsquo;s exercise time, the latter  including depression in making use of time, stress for making a timetable, and  a heavy workload that led straight to a lack of free time for adequate  exercise. In terms of the quality of the scale, the reliability analysis is  0.878 (Cronbach's α), and the exploratory factor analysis is 0.913  (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin, KMO). For the exploratory factor analysis, two factors  were been found that the cumulative explained variance rose to 66.50%. The  first factor, &lsquo;time perception&rsquo;, was composed of seven questions, while the  second factor, &lsquo;time pressure&rsquo;, was deduced from various answers to one  question. We used &lsquo;time perception&rsquo; for analysis in this study. <br>
    Besides, In Kao&rsquo;s study  (2010) indicated that sport participation time, perceived health and perceived  happiness had positive relationship  in the six  life stages. We agreed with this viewpoint and thought that time and pleasantness  had affected the sports participation. In this study, we used the DGBAS&rsquo;s data;  it surveyed items of &ldquo;happiness of life&rdquo; and &ldquo;health&rdquo;. This factor was called  &ldquo;Pleasantness Perception&rdquo;. </p>
  <h2>Statistical Method </h2>
  <p>At first, the descriptive statistics of the variables were analysed. The  differences were analysed using a t-test and one-way ANOVA. The prediction of  sports participation was analysed by categorical  multiple regression. In the end, the internal structure of sport  participation was deduced from a path  analysis. </p>
  <h2>Data Analysis </h2>
  <p>Descriptive statistics and regression were analysed by the software SPSS  13.0, and path analysis was performed by SEM using the software of LISREL 8.71. </p>
  <h1>RESULTS </h1>
  <h2>Descriptive Statistics </h2>
  <h3>Age:  The variable of age was  divided into 6 groups, 15~24 years old, 25~34 years old, 35~44 years old, 45~54  years old, 55~64 years old, and 65 years and over. Participants from the 25~34  year old group recorded the shortest sport participation time of 44.76  minutes per day, while the over 65 year  old group reported the longest time of 90.29 minutes. </h3>
  <h3>Education:  The participants&rsquo; educational backgrounds  were divided into 5 groups, that is, graduates from primary school, junior high  school, senior high school, college &amp; university, and post-graduate  research institutes. The group of research institute graduates had the shortest  sports participation time of 51.76 min per day, while the primary school  graduate group had the longest of 79.57 min. </h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Occupational Status: The item Occupational Status examined the participants&rsquo; socioeconomic  status, summarizing their power and income associated with 5 echelons in the  occupational structure, which was arbitrarily divided into 5 groups, i.e.,  income-workers (including self-employed home-based workers, and employees),  full-time students, home workers (such as caring for children, cooking,  cleaning, etc.), the unemployed  and retired citizens. The group of income-workers had the shortest sports  participation time of 54.34 min, while the retired citizens group had the  longest, rising to 92.73 min. </h3>
  <h3>Holiday Status: The variable &ldquo;Holiday Status&rdquo; was divided into 5 patterns for further analysis,  including irregular (or less than one day per week), one day a week, two days  every other week, two days a week, and unemployed.  The group who had one day a week reported the shortest sports participation  time of 51.11 min, while the group of unemployed  citizens had the longest time of 84.72 min. </h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Personal Income: The item &ldquo;Personal Income&rdquo; was divided into 5 groups, with wages or  salaries on a yearly basis, from under 200,000 NTD (~6,667 USD),  200,000~400,000 NTD (6,668~13,330 USD), 400,000~600,000 NTD (13,331~20,000USD),  600,000~800,000 NTD (20,001~26,667 USD), to an annual income of more than  800,000 NTD (26,668 USD~). The group of participants with a yearly income of  600,000~800,000 NTD (20,001~26,667 USD) demonstrated the least involvement in sports,  with only 58.91min. The group of under NT 200,000 had the longest sports  participation time of 77.60 min. (1USD = 30NTD).  See more details in Table 1.</h3>

  <h2>Categorical Multiple Regression Analysis </h2>
  <h3>Sports participation was the  dependent variable in this analysis, and there were 7 independent variables,  including 6 groups for age, 5 groups for education, 5 groups for occupational  status, 5 groups for holiday status, 5 groups for personal income, time perception and pleasantness  perception. The categorical multiple regression analysis was used to test the  data for an analysis of variance. In Table 3, the p-value was less than .05, showing a significant relationship  between the dependent and independent variables. Regression analysis on the  aforesaid categorical outcomes was  accomplished as  follows: </h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Sports  participation</strong> = .270× age +.149×occupation+.071×holiday status + .064× education + .062×time + .036×income － .052×pleasant</h3>

  <p>The R2 of the regression  model was .155, showing that 7 independent variables could only explain 15.5%, and that 84.5%  could not be explained. There were more important variables which did not fit  in with this regression model. For this study, age was the most important  factor for sports participation while the pleasantness  perception had a negative influence on sports participation, as show in Table 4.</p>

  <h2>Path analysis </h2>
  <p>Finally, we explored the assumption of the  study model through path analysis. The five exogenous variables including age, education,  occupation, holiday status and personal income were considered influences on one&rsquo;s sports participation coefficient with the &ldquo;time&rdquo; and  &ldquo;pleasantness&rdquo; perception as intermediaries. In the following path  diagram, the overall model fit indices in this analysis were χ2=706.87(p=.00),  RMSEA=.15, GFI=.97, AGFI=.80, CFI=.96, NFI=.96, NNFI=.80, and CN=114.12. Some  indices did not reach the standard values (RMSEA, AGFI, NNFI and CN). Bentler  (1983) argued that indices of RMSEA&lt;.05, AGFI&gt;.90, NNFI&gt;.90, and  CN&gt;200 could be regarded as the ideal fitness as shown in Table 5.</p>

  <p>The findings showed that even  though an overall model was of considerable significance in this case, some  indicators of fitness still failed to be justified as meaningful. In the path  diagram (Figure 1), all path coefficients were significant except for the  interrelation between holiday status and time perception (p*&lt;.05). <br>

    The Path Diagram of Sport Participation <br>
    This study was conducted via three  paths; the first one showed that the five variables (age, education,  occupation, holiday and income) influenced the participants&rsquo; decision-making  regarding sport participation, and the only valid prism resided in their  feeling of pleasantness. The path coefficients were .06, -.10, .23, -.10, -.06  and .04, respectively. The second route showed that the five variables  influence their sport participation through a compound of pleasantness and time  perceptions. The path coefficients were .06, -.10, .23, -.10, -.06, -.21 and  .23, respectively. The third one showed that the five variables influence sport  participation through time perception only. The path coefficients were .28,  -.16, .18, .03, -.08 and .23, respectively. The residual coefficients of  pleasantness perception, time perception and sport participation were .90, .69  and .95, respectively. </p>
  <h1>CONCLUSION </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>According  to the statistical results of this study, Taiwanese men in the age group 25~34  years old  had the shortest sport participation of 44.76 minutes per day. Those  participants over 65 years old  had the longest sport participation of 90.29 minutes. The older they were, the longer their sport participation lasted. As far as the variable &ldquo;Education&rdquo; is  concerned, the group with the highest academic background,  post-graduates, demonstrated the minimum involvement in sports of 51.76 min,  while the group of primary school graduates had the longest sport participation  of 79.57 min. The participants&rsquo; involvement in sports was inversely  proportional to their academic  achievement. As for the variable &ldquo;Occupational Status,&rdquo; the group with  regular jobs had the least free time, and their average sport participation was  54.34 min. On the other hand, the group of retired participants had most free  time, so their sport participation soared to the level of 92.73 min. The regularly employed workers and students  had the shortest sports participation, but the retired, the home workers and the unemployed displayed a higher  involvement in sports. The  variable &ldquo;Holiday Status&rdquo; testified to the fact that those participants who had only one  day off per week had the shortest sport participation of 51.11 min. Those unemployed participants happened to be  the most zealous participants in sports, with an average time expenditure of  84.72 min. Except for the jobless,  holiday status did not signify very much in the poll. The variable &ldquo;Personal  Income,&rdquo; however, mattered to the extent that a financially secure group,  with an income of 20,001~26,667 USD committed the least of their time to  sports, with 58.91 min. The group with the lowest income, an average wage of  less than 6,667 USD per year, had the longest sport participation of 77.60 min.  Except for the group who earned less  than 6,667 USD, other variables  had no significant influence on the participants&rsquo; involvement in sports.<br>
    The  categorical multiple regression showed that age was the most important variable  to influence the habit and persistence of sport participation (β =.270). However, the R2  of the regression model was .155, and 84.5% could not be thoroughly interpreted  or explained. <br>
    Path analysis indicated that sports  participation linked, among the five variables, primarily with time perception  (β=.23 and residual coefficient .69),  and pleasantness perception was secondary (β=.04 and residual coefficient.90). In addition, time perception  could interrelate and interact with the five variables without any interference  from pleasantness perception (β=-.21).  Therefore, the five variables (age, education, occupational status, holiday  status and personal income) influenced the indices of sport participation  through time perception, which was the most appropriate path. </p>
