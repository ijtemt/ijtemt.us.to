  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>Women  play a vital role in the economic development of the country, as her presence  is prominent in various fields such as agriculture, industrial organizations,  organized and un-organized sectors. Relating to this, the late Pandit  Jawaharlal Nehru a great visionary and an architect of modern India felt that  the development of women should be given top priority in the pattern of  economic development in the country.1<br>
    The  world of women is now no longer confined to periphery of house old activity  rather today they contribute in the promotion of economic development in  different capacities due to awareness in women, effects of women liberation  movement, and effect of women development organizations. This has increased the  female work participation rate from 14.22 in 1971 to 25.63 in 2001           .<br>
    Although  women form a very large proportion of the self-employed group, their work is  often not recognized as &ldquo;work&rdquo; because the prevailing &lsquo;house-hold strategy&rsquo;  catalyses the devaluation of women&rsquo;s productive activities as secondary and  subordinate to men&rsquo;s work. Women&rsquo;s contributions vary according to the  structure, needs, customs and attitudes of society. Women entered entrepreneurial  activities because of poor economic conditions, high unemployment rates and  divorce catapult. <br>
    Even  though, in recent years a great many changes occurred in the life of women all  over the world influencing their attitudes, values, inspirations, ways of  feelings and acting for effective participation in all walks of life, still  there occurs few social and economic barriers that prevents women in entering  any field of economic activity. The extent of women empowerment in the National  hierarchy is determined largely by three factors namely economic, social, and  political identity and their weight age. These factors are deeply intertwined  and interlinked with many cross cutting linkages which imply, that if efforts  in one dimension remain absent or weak, the other components cannot be  sustained as they will not be able to bear any sudden changes or upheavals.<br>
    Therefore,  it is only when all these three factors are simultaneously addressed and made  compatible with each other. Then only women can be truly empowered, thus for a  holistic empowerment of women–social, economic and political, aspects must  converge effectively on women&rsquo;s life. Therefore, we intended to study the  barriers of women entrepreneurs based on their own perspectives.</p>
  <h1>Procedure</h1>
  <h2>Meaning of Women Entrepreneurship</h2>
  <p>Women  Entrepreneurship as defined by Manorama vaid is an adult woman who undertakes  to organize own and run an enterprise2 Her illustration about women  entrepreneurs in India, represents a group of women&rsquo;s who have broken away from  the beaten track and exploring new vistas of economic participations. The task  of women entrepreneurs has been full of challenges and yet they have steer  clear of prejudice opposition, constraint and have established themselves as  successful entrepreneurs.</p>
  <h2>Review of Literature</h2>
  <p>Different  researchers have conducted several studies regarding the barriers of women  entrepreneurs. According to Amartya K. Sen &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s agency&rdquo; means anything that  gives women a voice of their own, a organization, a collective bargaining  process of their own to reduce their exploitation within the family and also  within the economy.<br>
    In  1983, Shruti and Sarupriya investigated the psychological factors affecting  women entrepreneurs; they examined the role of &lsquo;stresses&rsquo; experienced by the  women entrepreneurs. Their investigation, report that the unmarried women  entrepreneurs experienced less stress than married women entrepreneurs. Women  entrepreneurs from joint families experienced less amount of stress than from  nuclear families because they share their problems with other family members3<br>
    In 1984, Hisrich and Brush conducted  Nationwide in depth survey of women entrepreneurs and observed that the biggest  business start–up problems of the &ldquo;Typical&rdquo; women entrepreneurs were finance,  credit, and lack of business training. The greatest problem found was lack of  financial planning experienced by women.4            <br>
    In 1987, Van der and Romijn in a study  on small enterprises run by women observed that business headed by women were  consistently worse off than others. The few factors responsible for this were,  they generally had fewer resources than men, lower level of education and  literacy, and by restricted physical and occupational mobility. They also found  that, women have less contact, less burocratic know-how, and less bargaining  power than men that limited their productivity and profitability.5                <br>
    In 1991, Tovo observed that  self-employed women faced several problems in small scale enterprises due to  limited access to capitals, inputs and markets. The study also shows that a  large number of small enterprises share one market segment which cause  competition to be fierce and prices to be  low. Hence, the products of small enterprises extremely dependent on a limited  number of supplier and wholesalers. This made the women entrepreneur  economically vulnerable and often exposing her to exploitation.6 <br>
    In 1999, Mallika Das conducted a study  on the problems faced by women in initiating, running, and succeeding in  business both in developing and developed countries. This women&rsquo;s study  indicated that women differ from western counterparts in family background,  marital status, incubator organization issues and environmental factors in  getting funds for setting up of business and meeting working capital requirements.7<br>
    In 2004, Papisetty Rama Mohana Rao  found in the research study that Inadequate infrastructure, high labour  mobility, shortage of electricity and delayed realization of debtors were the  main problems faced by women entrepreneurs8.<br>
    The  above studies reveals that women entrepreneurs are playing very significant  role in the economic development of the country, but at the same time they are  facing desperate problems which are deter mental to the development of women  entrepreneurship. Thus, there is a need for more specific studies on women  entrepreneurship in India regarding their contribution to the economic  development.</p>
  <h2>Conceptual Framework for Research</h2>
  <p>The  discussion of the review of research literature depicts that there have been  quite a number of studies in recent years on barriers of women entrepreneurs,  but these available studies suffer from number of drawbacks. These studies  indicated the gaps to be filled in as well as need for further studies with  more empirical and theoretical support. However research studies with regard to  barriers of women entrepreneurs from Government organization and  Non-governmental organization are very scarce. <br>
    <br>
    Therefore it is felt that the holistic  approach to study the various barriers faced by women entrepreneurs is  essential for covering the performance of women entrepreneurs at macro level  with time series data analysis and at micro level a detailed analysis of  primary data collected from selected women entrepreneurs from both Government  and Non-governmental agencies.<br>
    <br>
    It is pertinent to mention that the  number of women entrepreneurs both in absolute and real terms have not reached  the critical mass to make an impact on the economic system. Women entrepreneurs  continue to be insignificant in numbers hence, to gain legitimacy, acceptance  and visibility for their work, efforts should be made to improve their  operations quantitatively and qualitatively. Therefore, an imminent need for a  catalyst to motivate more women to take up entrepreneurship, encourage them to realize  their potential by making use of the available opportunities and sensitizing  the implementing agencies to the requirements of women entrepreneurs. There are  several associations and organizations that help entrepreneurship activities in  the economy namely Karnataka State Women Development Corporation [KSWDC],  Association of Women Entrepreneurs in Karnataka [AWAKE], Self Employed Women&rsquo;s  Association [SEWA], Centre for entrepreneurship development for women [CED] of  CANARA banks, Commercial banks, Co-operative banks, Technical Consultancy  Organizations [TCOs], Technical Consultancy Services Organization of Karnataka  [TECSOK], Self-Help Groups [SHGs], Central and State Government Schemes etc.  Amongst that, our study is mainly focusing to evaluate the barriers that limits  the women development activities of Government and Non- Government agencies  such as KSWDC and AWAKE.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>The  aim and objective of the study is to identify and evaluate the various  constraints/barriers faced by the women entrepreneurs in AWAKE and KSWDC with  respect to Garments, Handicrafts, and food sectors</p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>To  collect the primary data for this research study we followed the multistage  sampling design for selection of women entrepreneurs in garments, handicrafts  and food sectors from AWAKE and KSWDC in Bangalore urban district purposively.  The suitable questionnaire was prepared and given to women entrepreneurs and  interviewed. The necessary information gathered through appropriate questions  in the primary survey identifies the barriers of women entrepreneurs in both  the selected organization.  The barriers  of the women entrepreneurs is depicted in the form of research model fig 1:</p>

  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>Women  not only face barriers as entrepreneurs but as women themselves and therefore  compared to men the problems of women entrepreneurs are numerous. The problems  of women ranges from mobilizing various resources including the barriers  of financial constraints, marketing, raw  materials, sales, labour, technical, competition, new technology, power cuts, lack  of family support, lack of training, lack of awareness, lack of government  support etc.  <br>
    Hence  their problems arise from within and outside and also differ from enterprise to  enterprise. Some of these barriers are similar to all women entrepreneurs,  where as for some others it is more specific and related to the line of  activity of the enterprise. Whatever may be the problem for the entrepreneurs  there is no prescribed formula to deal with them. Therefore the problems have  to be dealt by themselves otherwise it would affect the working environment of  the enterprise itself. So efficient and timely handling of the problems leads  them to their success. <br>
    Recognizing  the problems faced by women entrepreneurs, various studies have attempted to  classify the constraints unique to them. According to Mishra (1991) the  constraints were distinguished on the basis of intrinsic, operational and  socio-cultural problem9. Similarly, Lalitha Iyer&rsquo;s (1991) classification spelt  out psychological and socio-cultural constraints which hampered business  operations10. Kamala Singh (1992) attempted a fourfold categorization on  constraints such as self-sphere constraint, socio-psycho sphere constraint,  resource system constraint and support system constraint11. These  classifications reveal that the problems faced by the women entrepreneurs are  either intrinsic or extrinsic in nature.

  <p><strong>TABLE 1: Major Problems faced by  the Women1Entrepreneurs Sector wise Units in Numbers along with sub categories  in different units (Primary Data) Note: Figures in brackets represent the  percentage to the respective sector totals</strong><br>
    Garments-75,  Handicrafts-25, Food-15, Total-75  <br>
    Table-1 illustrates the major problems  faced by the sample women entrepreneurs while starting and running the  enterprise. The above primary data reveals that majority of 68 (90.66%)  beneficiaries from both the organizations respectively faced financial  constraints during their entrepreneurial activity. It is found that more than  85 percent of the sample women entrepreneurs from Garments, Handicrafts and  Food sector from both the organizations face these problems. Though finance is the  most important aspect of any enterprise whether it is big or small, the sample  women entrepreneurs suffered from shortage of finance due to non- availability  of long term finance, regular and frequent need of working capital and long  procedure to avail financial help, complicated banking procedures, insistence  on collateral and the attitudes of bankers, too many dependents etc. This often  forced sample women entrepreneurs to plan on non-institutional sources of  credit such as family, friends and money lenders. Several studies reveal that  the biggest problem of the women entrepreneurs is finance problem, this  confirms our study. <br>
    The  access to credit is a main obstacle for growing enterprises this was proved  when the sample women entrepreneurs were asked about the difficulty level of  the current borrowing procedure and terms and conditions of loan. The above  table shows that 54 (72%) entrepreneurs from AWAKE and 60 (80%) beneficiaries  from KSWDC faced the problem of access to credit as they were often denied  credit by bankers on the ground of lack of collateral security. This  complicated procedure of bank loans as deterred many sample women entrepreneurs  to venture and expand their unit. If banks provide loans at lower interests at  appropriate time many beneficiaries would like to expand their unit, increase  their production and market their goods at international level. Nearly 27 (77%)  of the women entrepreneurs from Garments, 17 (68%) from Handicrafts and 10  (66%) from Food sectors face access to credit problems in both the  organizations. This reveals that Garment entrepreneurs are affected much from  access to credit problems rather than Food sectors. This may be due to the fact  that majority of the food products are produced on the basis of self investment  as most of the production units are tiny and small.         <br>
    The second major problem faced by the  sample women entrepreneurs was marketing problems. Out of 75 sample women  entrepreneurs 66 (88%) from AWAKE and 65 (86.66%) from KSWDC faced this problem  while marketing their products. Nearly, 32 (91%) of the women entrepreneurs  from Garments, 21 (84%) from Handicrafts and 12 (80%) from Food sectors  experienced this problem in both the organizations. This reflects that Garment  women entrepreneurs are affected much from market problems rather than Food  sectors. This may be due to the fact that majority of the food products are  produced on the basis of bulk orders and large number of products are sold to  regular customers. The major marketing constraints faced by the sample women  entrepreneurs were lack of demand, tough competition from large scale units,  poor location of shop, lack of transport facility, lack of marketing knowledge,  lack of marketing center, no frequent exhibitions, increase in rental charges,  no free stalls, bargaining attitude of the customers, middle men, male  dominated markets, lack of awareness, lack of risk bearing etc. Several studies  proved that even amongst successful women entrepreneur, one in every five faced  the problems related to markets. Hence no women entrepreneur is free from  marketing problem.<br>
    It  is observed from the above table that 58 (77.33%) women entrepreneurs   from AWAKE and 52 (69.33%) women  entrepreneurs from KSWDC faced the problem of lack of demand and nearly 60  (80%) to 65 (86%) of the women entrepreneurs from both the organizations faced  the problem of heavy competition and lack of awareness and only 16 (21.33%)  women entrepreneurs   from AWAKE and 11  (14.66) women entrepreneurs from KSWDC faced the problem of risk bearing. This  data reveals that majority of the women entrepreneurs from both the  organizations faced the constraints regarding marketing their products. Hence  due to these problems many women entrepreneurs   were not able to get more returns and 3 to 4 women entrepreneurs  from both the organizations closed their unit  due to lack of demand and heavy competition. It is noticed that more than 75  percent of the beneficiaries from Garments, Handicrafts and Food sector from both  the organizations experience the problems of lack of demand, heavy competition  and lack of awareness and only minimal number of women entrepreneurs face lack  of risk bearing. <br>
    The  table also furnishes the production problems faced by the sample beneficiaries  from both the organizations. As per the table 60 (80%) women entrepreneurs from  AWAKE and 58 (77.33%) women entrepreneurs from KSWDC comes under production  problems. The production problems faced by maximum (76%) respondents from both  the organizations in all sectors were high cost of production. High cost of  production undermines the efficiency and stands in the way of development and  expansion of the enterprises. Government assistance in the form of grants and  subsidies to some extent enables them to tide over the difficult situations. Increase  in the prices of raw materials, wages, rent, machinery equipments, marketing  expenditure etc. leads to high cost of production. <br>
    Nearly  50 (66%) women entrepreneurs  from both  the organizations have lack of training facility, This leads them to face the  problems like imperfection of work, delay in production, low quality  production, unskilled, unaware of technological knowhow, lack of marketing  strategy, inadequate competency, lack of preservation technique etc. These  problems hinder their production in the competitive world which in turn makes  them economically weak. Similarly, irregular, insufficient and untimely supply  of raw materials disrupts the efficiency of a targeted production schedule. In  our study 44 (58.66%) women entrepreneurs from AWAKE and 50 (66.66%)  beneficiaries from KSWDC face this scarcity of raw materials problems. <br>
    Another  constraint faced by the sample beneficiaries in production is labour problem.  Nearly 50 (66%) women entrepreneurs   of  AWAKE and 37 (49.33%) women entrepreneurs    from KSWDC suffered from labour problems. This indicates that the labour  problems faced by AWAKE is 26 percent higher than KSWDC labour problems. As  majority of the production is on the basis of orders they appoint temporary  workers. These temporary workers are in scarce or they may demand high wages,  lack of punctuality, lack of efficiency, lack of ignorance etc reduces the  production, this in turn affect their demand. <br>
    Likewise,  lack of skilled laborers is also another constraint faced by the sample  beneficiaries. The table depicts that 46 (61.33%) women entrepreneurs from  AWAKE and 36 (48%) women entrepreneurs from KSWDC experienced this problem. As  many experienced laborers leave the unit after gaining sufficient exposure the  production and quality of the products decrease. Hence, women entrepreneurs  should put some efforts to make friend with colleagues and have a concern for  their welfare by providing help in every way. This makes them to feel  duty-bound to their employer and solves the labour related problems. This  problem is found to be high in Garment and Handicraft sector as majority of the  sample beneficiary&rsquo;s needs skilled labourers to produce and export their  products at international levels to maintain quality and quantity.  <br>
    It  is evinced from the table that power cut problem reduces the production of the  unit as 35 (46.66%) women entrepreneurs    from AWAKE and 40 (53.34%) women entrepreneurs   from KSWDC use modern advanced technique in  their production. Therefore, 27 (36%) beneficiaries from AWAKE and 32 (42.66%)  beneficiaries from KSWDC face this problem. Related to this, 53 (70.66%)  beneficiaries from both the organizations respectively experience the  technological problem. Lack of technical know-how declines the production, lack  of specialized skills results in poor maintenance of machinery, repairs pose  additional problems. Hence, women entrepreneurs should be aware of the  different Scientific and Industrial Research (SIR) laboratories and other  agencies which provide technical and technological consultancy and guidance. It  is observed that majority of the production constraints are faced by Garment  beneficiaries in both the organizations than other two sectors.  <br>
    The  major Health problems faced by the sample women entrepreneurs were tension,  backache, eyestrain fatigue, respiratory problem, blood pressure, gastric  trouble etc. These problems arise due to lack of rest and sleep, heavy  schedule, uncomfortable working place etc. As she is bound with family tie she  is busy in making a fine balance between business and home and lack of  concentration on her leads to health hazards. In our study 8 (10.66%) women  entrepreneurs from AWAKE and 5 (6.66%) women entrepreneurs from KSWDC faced  health problems, amongst them 2 to 3 women entrepreneurs from both the  organizations closed their unit due to this reason. Majority of the women  entrepreneurs who faced health problems were found in AWAKE rather than  KSWDC.  <br>
    This  table proclaims that 51 (68%) women entrepreneurs from AWAKE and 47 (62.66%)  women entrepreneurs from KSWDC experienced the working place problems. The  major problem faced by the sample women entrepreneurs was their inability to  get allocation for themselves of an adequate and appropriate place for their  units to be located. The government&rsquo;s attitude, although helpful at  micro-level, did not translate into effective action in allotting place for  their entrepreneurial activity. This often forced them to settle in a congested  place at their home itself. This insufficient place backed up their productive  activity in large scale. This problem seems to be high in Garment and  Handicraft sector when compared to Food sector in both the organizations. <br>
    This  table also furnishes the general problems faced by the sample women  entrepreneurs in their entrepreneurial activity. As revealed from the table it  is found that 61 (81.33%) women entrepreneurs from AWAKE and 63 (84%) women  entrepreneurs from KSWDC experienced general problems relating to lack of  family support, social attitude, lack of education etc. Majority of the general  problems are faced from Garment women entrepreneurs   rather than Handicrafts and Food sector. The  general major problem faced by the sample women entrepreneurs is lack of family  support. Family support is of crucial importance in the decision-making process  for the women entrepreneurs and depending on the response from the family, the  women entrepreneurs can either be highly motivated in her new venture or  completely demotivated. In our study 58 (77.33%) women entrepreneurs from AWAKE  and 57 (76%) women entrepreneurs from KSWDC lack family support in their  entrepreneurial activity. This discouragement from the home, coupled with  opposition from society at large, created emotional and physical barriers on  the sample women entrepreneurs.         <br>
    Likewise,  lack of information/education is also a barrier to the sample women  entrepreneurs in their entrepreneurial activity. The gender imbalance in terms  of educational attainment display women in a negative disproportional in  management, marketing and banking procedure compared to men. In our study  majority of them are under graduates hence, they lack the information regarding  latest technological developments and market trends. This lack of information  hinders them to start and run the business successfully. It is observed that  nearly 41 (54.66%) women entrepreneurs from both the organizations face this  constraint. More than 50 percent of the women entrepreneurs from all the  sectors face this problem. <br>
    Similarly,  social attitude is regarded as the most important stumbling block in the path  of women entrepreneurship. Despite constitutional equality, there is wide  spread discrimination against women as it is male dominated society. Though  women have potential the social attitudes prevent her to become a successful  and independent entrepreneur. This table exhibit that more than 60 percent of  the women entrepreneurs face this constraints. Majority of the women  entrepreneurs who face this constraint are found in Food sector. <br>
    Every  entrepreneur faces some problems or the other in running the enterprises. As  women are not exceptions from these hurdles. However, 16 (21.33%) women  entrepreneurs   from AWAKE and 15 (20%)  women entrepreneurs from KSWDC stated that they did not face any problems severely  by the virtue of being women, excepting the minor problems of performing duties  both at home and business. This indicates a good turning point in the sense  that women are developing confidence to undertake any work, thereby shedding  inhibitions and this would encourage many aspiring women entrepreneurs to  plunge into business. </p>
  <h1>Conclusion </h1>
  <p>Despite  all this constraints, successful women entrepreneurs do exist. Women  entrepreneurs have evidently more to &lsquo;acquire&rsquo; than their male counterparts.  But, the socio-cultural environment in which women are born and raised hinders  them. Social customs, caste restrictions, culture restraints and norms leave  women lagging behind men. Hence, they are mentally geared to slip into an  entrepreneurial activity because of their family orientation, restricted  mobility, and limited access to resources. But, given the opportunity,  direction and guidance, they are capable of overcoming these limitations.  Therefore, there is a need of co-ordination among the academic institutions such  as colleges, universities and research institutions to offer training and  counseling to the aspiring women entrepreneurs. The government and  non-government organizations must effectively work and commit themselves to  promote and encourage women entrepreneurs not only in traditional and feminine  nature of products but also modern, non-feminine and hi-tech areas. In our  study AWAKE and KSWDC are promoting and encouraging women entrepreneurs from  both rural and urban areas in all fields of life. They assist them providing  skill development programs, entrepreneurship development program, management  development program, guidance, counseling, provide latest information regarding  production, marketing, financing etc.</p>
