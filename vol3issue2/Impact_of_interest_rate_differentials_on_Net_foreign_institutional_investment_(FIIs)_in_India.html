  <p><em>Abstract</em>— This paper examines  the effect of interest rate differential on net capital flows to India by  taking net foreign institutional investments as proxy for capital flow. Monthly  data from April, 2005 to December, 2012 were procured and analyzed using time  series econometric modeling. The co-integration results show that interest rate  differential does not have any significant long-run impact on net foreign  institutional investments flows to India. Further, only two variables namely,  foreign exchange rate and Bombay stock exchange return have significant impact  on Net foreign institutional investments and between the two, Bombay stock  exchange index/return is the major pull factor for Net foreign institutional  investments flows into Indian financial market. Results imply that monetary policy  actions should continue to be guided by objectives related to inflation and  growth and the management of capital flows resulting from monetary policy  actions should be left to other instruments.<br>

  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Difference  in interest rate has often been considered as a major determinant of capital  flows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and at times, it is felt that that  changes in monetary policy measures (conditioned on inflation-growth  objectives) could dampen or magnify the volume of capital flows into a country.  In this context, it is generally assumed that countries with relatively higher  interest rate as compared to others would attract larger capital flows. For  most of 2010 and 2011, there was widening in the growth as well as the interest  rate differentials due multi-speed recovery of world economy and asymmetric  monetary exit, creating concerns that there might be surges in capital flows to  EMEs, which had to be managed. While EMEs used many possible instruments such  as sterilized intervention to manage overvaluation of exchange rate, use of  macro-prudential measures to stem risks to asset prices or use of capital  controls to contain the magnitude of capital inflows, there is little support  as yet to the claim that monetary policy actions were delayed just because of  the risk they might pose in terms of influencing the composition and magnitude  of capital flows. <br>
    Before  the advent of global financial crisis, India had experienced surges in capital  flows which were in excess of the financial needs of the current account  deficit and therefore number of instruments such as sterilized intervention, a  more open current account to push capital outflows by residents and occasional  use of prudential measures to discourage capital inflows were used to manage  the surplus. However, since the second half of 2010-11, unlike other EMEs,  India has witnessed a relatively larger currency account deficit, suggesting  the need for higher stable capital inflows. As a result, while the concerns  relating to anti-inflationary policy attracting excessively larger capital  inflows have eased, the use of interest rate to manage the composition and  magnitude of capital flows is continuing. In this context, this paper focuses  on whether actions of central bank (RBI) which affect interest rate  differentials have been a major determinant of capital flows to India..</p>
  <h1>Objective/Testable Hypothesis</h1>
  <p>Capital  flows to India principally has four components i.e. Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI), Foreign Institutional Investments (FIIs), External Commercial Borrowings  (ECBs) and Deposits of NRI. While the share of ECBs and NRI deposits in the  total capital flows is very small (14% and 6.6% respectively)1, FDI  is not likely to be affected by interest rate differentials as it depends on  long-term fundamentals of the economy (Verma and Prakash, 2011)2.  This paper, therefore, ignores other three components of capital flows and  focuses only on foreign institutional investments as a proxy for capital flows  and thereby analyze how net foreign institutional investment (NFII) is affected  by interest rate differentials. The graph below shows how net foreign  institutional investment has fluctuated in the recent periods (from April, 2005  to December, 2012).  <br>

  <h1>Background: Literature Review</h1>
  <p>Reference  [3] tested for co-integration between net foreign capital inflows, real  exchange rate and interest rate differential using quarterly data for the  period 1993 to 2003. He found long-run relationship between these variables. He  found an error correction mechanism for the post-liberalization period which  related dynamic adjustment to capital flows to the movement in the interest  rate differential and the real exchange rate. <br>
    Reference  [4] studies the determinants of various components of equity flows and private  debt flows to India. He found a high correlation between interest rate  differential and ECB disbursements. He also found that there is strong  co-movement of domestic activity and ECBs. Moreover, he observed that long run  demand for external commercial borrowing by Indian corporate is affected by the  pace of interest rate differentials, followed by pace of domestic real activity  and domestic market&rsquo;s credit conditions. With regard to portfolio investment,  he found co-movement in the volatility of daily net FIIs and stock returns.  Granger causality test showed the short run causal relationship between  portfolio investment flows and stock prices. In addition, the Johansen&rsquo;s  approach to co-integration analysis implied a long-run relationship between the  two variables.<br>
    Reference  [5] studied the factors affecting portfolio investment flows into India using  multivariate regression on monthly data for the period 1993-2011. They found  that foreign institutional investments (FIIs) in India are affected by both  domestic and external factors and qualitatively both have the equal importance.  Important external factors were; external interest rate which adversely  affected FII flows into India and the performance of emerging stocks which  positively affected FII flows.  Among  domestic factors, credit rating downgrades, depreciation of rupee and lagged  domestic stock market returns were found to affect net FII flows negatively.  The existence of positive relationship between portfolio inflows and expected  domestic returns and negative relationship between lagged domestic stock return  and portfolio inflows has been explained by the authors in terms of bargain hunters  (i.e. &ldquo;buying on the dips&rdquo;) which mean FIIs buying when market falls and FIIs  selling of after the market rises. In order to check the robustness of this  result, they estimated Vector autoregressive model (VAR) using daily data of  BSE returns, FII flows and exchange rate in the forward market. They found a  negative coefficient of lagged domestic stock market return with respect to FII  flows. <br>
    Reference  [6] studied the determinants of foreign capital flows into Turkey using  Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) model, variance decomposition  functions and impulse response function for the period January 1992 to December  2005. Push-pull factors approach was used. As pull factors, he took Istanbul  stock exchange index, current account balance, budget balance and real interest  rate on Turkish T-Bills. As pull factors, he took US industrial production  index and Interest rate on 3-month US T-Bills. Result was general dominance of  pull factors over push factors in determining foreign capital flows into Turkey.  More specifically, he found that capital flows were negatively related with  budget balance and current account balance. He found a positive relationship  between capital flows and stock market index. Moreover, he found that a shock  in real interest rate in Turkey resulted in immediate capital outflow in Turkey  between the periods January, 1992 to December, 2005.<br>
    Reference  [7] conducted cross sectional study of 8 countries; Argetina, India, Australia,  Indonesia, Chile, Columbia, Brazil and Mexico using SUR analysis for factors  affecting capital flows. According to his study, one of the important factors  affecting capital flows in all of these 8 countries was their foreign exchange  reserves and the level of gross domestic product was the another factor influencing  capital flows in these countries.<br>
    In  totality, there are many factors that affect capital flows in an economy. This  paper looks to determine the important factors affecting capital flows in India  and whether monetary policy actions have any ramification on the capital  inflows in India (particularly on FIIs).<br>
  </p>
  <h1>Theoretical framework</h1>
  <p>Let  there be perfect capital mobility in world capital market. Let &lsquo;id&rsquo; denotes  interest rate in domestic country on government bond and &lsquo;if&rsquo; denotes foreign  interest rate (US in present study). The equilibrium in the world capital  market would occur at a point where assets of all countries will offer same  expected return, when they are expressed in same currency. This particular  condition of equilibrium in world capital market is known as &ldquo;Uncovered  Interest Parity Condition (UIP)&rdquo;. Mathematically, it is represented as. <br>

Given the definitions, the term  <br>

    The  left hand side (LHS) of condition (1) denotes expected return on domestic  assets while the right hand side denotes expected return on foreign assets in  terms of domestic currency, measured by   the sum of foreign interest rate and expected depreciation of domestic  currency against foreign currency.  The  condition (1) can be rewritten as:      <br>

    The left hand side (LHS)  of condition (2) is called expected return differentials between the assets of  two nations and can be assumed as a proxy for interest rate differentials  between the two nations. As per UIP hypothesis, if there is a positive expected  return differential (i.e. if left hand side of equation (2) is positive), there  will be inflow of foreign capital in the economy. However, if expected return  differential is negative, there will be outflow of foreign capital. The further  analysis is based on these premises.<br>
    V.  Methodology–Model  Specification, Definition of  Variable  and Data Collection, and Econometrics Methodology </p>
  <h2>Model Specification</h2>
  <p>Although the whole analysis is built on premises mentioned in  section 3, there are other factors also which affect capital flows in  developing countries like India such as stock market return, change in exchange  rate, industrial production index, inflation, rate of growth in OECD nations  etc. Therefore, to control for such variables along with interest rate  differential, multivariate time series model has been used, represented as  below<br>

  <h2>Econometric Methodology</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Time series econometric techniques8 were used to estimate the  multivariate time series model represented by equation 3 in the previous  section. In the process, following steps were followed</li>
    <li>In time series data, problem of non-stationarity is encountered,  which results in spurious relationships among the variables of interest. To  check stationarity of each variable, Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test was  used.</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Granger Causality test was used to determine the causal/short term  relationship between different variables.</li>
    <li>If there is any causal relationship, Johansen co-integration  estimation procedure was used to derive long-term relationship between the  variables.</li>
    <li>Lastly, if variables were co-integrated, error correction model  (ECM) was estimated to know the speed of adjustment parameters.</li>

  <p>Table 2 presents the results of unit root and the order of  integration. Sequential procedure for testing the unit root under ADF test was  run.<br>
    It  was noted that all variables except oecd_growth are non-stationary (i.e. have  unit root) at the level; however, all variables become stationary (i.e. have no  unit root) at the first difference. This implies that all variables except  oecd_growth are integrated of order one. <br>
    The Granger causality test  on monthly data (from April 2005 to December 2012) in VAR framework showed a  unidirectional causality between net foreign institutional investment inflow  and interest rate differential (between 91 days Indian government T-bills and  US 3-month T-bills) implying interest rate differential granger caused net FII  flows to India. This short-run relationship between net FII and interest rate  differential does not conform to the perception that FII flows are primarily  influenced by asset price movements rather than interest rates. In this  context, it is important to point out that a portion of FII is made in debt  instruments which are likely to be affected by change in interest rate  differential. The result for granger causality has been represented in the  table 3 and table 4.</p>

    As granger causality  test showed a causal relationship from interest rate differential to FII flows,  which was not in conformity with the theoretical expectations. It was necessary  to examine the relationship further and check whether there was existence of  any long-run relationship between interest rate differential and FII flows  using the Johansen co-integration framework.   For this, net FII flow was taken as dependent variable and interest rate  differential, logarithm of rupee/dollar exchange rate, logarithm of index for  industrial production in India, logarithm of Bombay stock exchange index and  inflation rate as independent variables. The coefficient of BSE index and  foreign exchange rate were found to be statistically significant, indicating  that these variables impact FII inflows, however, interest rate differential  and index of industrial production (IIPIndia) were found to be statistically  insignificant. This result was in contrast to the unidirectional causality  which was found using granger causality test from interest rate differential to  FII inflows. Thus, as per co-integration framework, interest rate differential  does not have any significant long-run impact on net FII flows to India. It  might possible that in the short run, when there is increase in domestic  interest rate, bond price falls, thus become attractive to the investors, and  thereby inducing some investors to switch portfolio from shares to bonds. This,  as a result, may cause equity prices to fall (as demand for equity would fall)  and may possibly result in large buying of equity by FIIs to take advantage of  lower stock prices. Such behavior may explain the short-run causal relationship  which existed from interest rate differential to Net FIIs.</p>

  <p>Taking exchange rate, co-integration results established negative  relationship between Net FII and exchange rate. This may be because increase in  exchange rate (i.e. depreciation of rupee) would mean decline in the expected  return on Indian assets, thereby causing FIIs to fall and vice versa. The sign  of coefficient of IIP India is negative which does not conform to theoretical  expectation as was expected Net FII to increase as IIP in India increases.  However, since the variable is insignificant, the wrong sign is not much of the  problem. The sign of BSE index is positive. This positive relationship between  Net FII and BSE index signifies that an increase in BSE return results in  increase in FII flows to India as Indian assets become more attractive for  investment. As expected, BSE index/return is the major pull factor for Net FII  flows into Indian financial market, with 1% increase in BSE Index causing net  FII to increase by 4,308 crore rupees.</p>
  <p>VII.         Conclusion <br>
    This study has empirically tested the sensitivity of interest rate  differential on NetFII (proxy for capital flows) into Indian financial market.  The study (using co-integration framework) shows that interest rate differential  does not have any significant long-run impact on net FII flows to India.  Nevertheless, they may exist some short run causal relationship from interest  rate differential to FII flows due to the fact that a portion of FII is made in  debt instruments which are likely to be affected by change in interest rate  differential.<br>
    Changes  in foreign exchange rate and stock market index (BSE index) are found to have  statistically significant impact on Net FII flows into India and between the  two, BSE index is the major pull factor for Net FII flows (capital flows) into  Indian financial market.<br>
    Thus, in view of monetary policy, changes in interest rate do not  have significant impact on net FDI and FII flows as they are primarily  determined by long-run growth prospects of Indian economy and stock market  returns respectively. In other words, monetary policy actions (which affect  interest rate differential) are not a major determinant of capital flows to  India. The implication of this result is that monetary policy actions should  continue to be guided by objectives related to inflation and growth and the  management of capital flows resulting from monetary policy actions should be  left to other instruments.</p>
