Paper Title : <br>JOURNALISM IN THE AGE OF MEDIA CONVERGENCE:<br>
A SURVEY OF UNDERGRADUATES’ TECHNOLOGY-RELATED NEWS HABITS 
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The Web and its related technologies have significantly influenced not only the ways that news is consumed, but also how journalism education and the training of news professionals are undertaken. Consequently, many undergraduate journalism programs are now grappling with curriculum issues that didn’t previously exist, such as whether to immerse students in writing/reporting that spans across media platforms or cling to the tradition of dividing students into specialized journalistic tracks. 
With 5,000-plus newspapers worldwide currently offering online editions, “the Internet is an essential link for scholars and students studying journalism.”  It is not surprising, then, that “the effects of new communication technologies are forcing [journalism education] to expand, whether we like it or not.” 
Undeniably, the Internet has influenced the news habits of society, and especially among a younger and better-educated demographic.  Similarly, Yau and Al-Hawamdeh report that “the Internet, with its headline news format and its capacity for quick updates, is clearly attractive to younger news consumers. The Internet’s hypertext-based ability to provide more depth on a subject also appeals to those with large news appetites … [and] as a result, the growth of Internet news has had a dramatic impact on the way people with access to technology get information on business and financial matters.” 
Although communication theorist McLuhan  has said the content of any medium is always another medium, it is economic pressures that have fueled the efficiency-focused trend for media companies to have a single news staff instead of two or more.  Related to this, Outing reports that “today’s writers will be wise to look upon the craft of writing and reporting as requiring multiple talents. If you gain some additional skills—such as the ability to knock off an audio segment to accompany a text article—you’ll be more attractive to employers and command a higher salary.” 
Thanks to media convergence, then, which has been cited as the most significant development in the news industry during the past century , journalists now operate in an age where “writers increasingly are being asked to perform other communication tasks, from recording audio, to shooting photographs and video, to participating in interactive discussions with readers” 
As for the need for journalists to train across media platforms, Kraeplin and Criado warn that “those entering a convergence environment today are encountering a complex system,” where the ever-increasing demands “of a converged media system ensure that … journalists’ careers will be less stable and predictable than in the past,” thanks to the new reality that today’s reporters will likely experience a career that crosses into other media versus one that never diverts from its original journalistic discipline or medium.

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>The  Web and its related technologies have significantly influenced not only the  ways that news is consumed, but also how journalism education and the training  of news professionals are undertaken. Consequently, many undergraduate  journalism programs are now grappling with curriculum issues that didn&rsquo;t  previously exist, such as whether to immerse students in writing/reporting that  spans across media platforms or cling to the tradition of dividing students  into specialized journalistic tracks. <br>
    With  5,000-plus newspapers worldwide currently offering online editions, &ldquo;the  Internet is an essential link for scholars and students studying  journalism.&rdquo;  It is not surprising, then,  that &ldquo;the effects of new communication technologies are forcing [journalism  education] to expand, whether we like it or not.&rdquo; <br>
    Undeniably,  the Internet has influenced the news habits of society, and especially among a  younger and better-educated demographic.   Similarly, Yau and Al-Hawamdeh report that &ldquo;the Internet, with its  headline news format and its capacity for quick updates, is clearly attractive  to younger news consumers. The Internet&rsquo;s hypertext-based ability to provide  more depth on a subject also appeals to those with large news appetites … [and]  as a result, the growth of Internet news has had a dramatic impact on the way  people with access to technology get information on business and financial  matters.&rdquo; <br>
    Although  communication theorist McLuhan  has said  the content of any medium is always another medium, it is economic pressures  that have fueled the efficiency-focused trend for media companies to have a  single news staff instead of two or more.   Related to this, Outing reports that &ldquo;today&rsquo;s writers will be wise to  look upon the craft of writing and reporting as requiring multiple talents. If  you gain some additional skills—such as the ability to knock off an audio  segment to accompany a text article—you&rsquo;ll be more attractive to employers and  command a higher salary.&rdquo; <br>
    Thanks  to media convergence, then, which has been cited as the most significant  development in the news industry during the past century , journalists now  operate in an age where &ldquo;writers increasingly are being asked to perform other communication  tasks, from recording audio, to shooting photographs and video, to  participating in interactive discussions with readers&rdquo; <br>
    As  for the need for journalists to train across media platforms, Kraeplin and  Criado warn that &ldquo;those entering a convergence environment today are  encountering a complex system,&rdquo; where the ever-increasing demands &ldquo;of a  converged media system ensure that … journalists&rsquo; careers will be less stable  and predictable than in the past,&rdquo; thanks to the new reality that today&rsquo;s reporters  will likely experience a career that crosses into other media versus one that  never diverts from its original journalistic discipline or medium.</p>
  <h1>Purpose of Study</h1>
  <p>This  study sampled the news-reading habits of undergraduates at a single university  for the purposes of augmenting and synthesizing the available body of knowledge  surrounding contemporary journalism in practice and from an educational  standpoint.<br>
    Although research on interactive  communication technology has begun to emerge, research that specifically deals  with news consumption and the news-reading habits of the public, including  college students, in the age of the Internet remained limited at the time this  study was undertaken. <br>
    Related  to this, &ldquo;There is a constructive role that universities can and ought to play  in determining the future direction of journalism on the Internet,&rdquo; as well as  how journalism is taught within higher education. <br>
    Subsequently, any identifiable  patterns or motivators of news consumption, especially where one medium is  chosen over another, provides valuable information for the creators and  practitioners of news and media sources, including newspaper editors, online  editors and page designers, as well as for some sociologists and those engaged  in teaching and designing journalism curriculum at the undergraduate level.</p>
  <h1>Liiterature Review</h1>
  <h2>Defining Journalism Education </h2>
  <p>Although  research about journalism and among journalists has been theorized, studied and  critically analyzed by many from a variety of disciplines, a lack of consensus  exists within the dialogue concerning journalism studies.  According to some, this deficit in consensus  remains in place because as a field, journalism is forced to balance between  the industry and the university, each of which possesses a unique set of  institutionalized assumptions and expectations. Related to this, one  communication scholar has observed that journalism education is &ldquo;neither fish  nor fowl; it feels itself unloved by the industry and tolerated, barely, by the  academy.&rdquo; <br>
    Reportedly,  even newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer had misgivings now and again about the  appropriateness of journalism as a program of study within the university.  Adding to the identity crisis of journalism  education is the variety of perspectives or disciplines employed by those who  try to understand journalism and its related studies; namely, those trained in  the social sciences and those scholars who hail from critical humanities  backgrounds. <br>
    In  academe, internal debates about where journalism&rsquo;s rightful home should be  continue to exist.   In fact, per some  observers and media historians, one of the key factors that slowed the growth  and development of journalism education in the United States during the last  century occurred when the founders of communication studies as a distinct  discipline decided journalism&rsquo;s home was in this academic area.  During this time &ldquo;the focus of communication  studies not only ignored the practice of journalism but was often philosophically  opposed to the values and mission of journalism. Communication studies, in much  of its research, focused on learning to control the mass audience rather than  on how to serve the information needs of citizens. … [Moreover, there was a]  lack of respect that communication studies scholars often had for journalists  and for those who taught journalism. Rather than seeing the skills of  journalism as intellectual skills, they saw them as &lsquo;toys.&rsquo; <br>
    With  these challenges not so far in their past, then, contemporary journalism  educators and scholars, in today&rsquo;s fast-paced, technology-driven media  environment, are left little time to contemplate how to best define journalism  education in its current state or its ideal role. However, as one journalism  scholar has observed, &ldquo;Neither practicing journalists nor journalism educators  can afford to stop asking basic questions—like &lsquo;What is news?&rsquo;—in the rapidly  changing environment that has become a staple of today&rsquo;s world.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2>Barriers to Convergence</h2>
  <p>Defined  as &ldquo;teaching students to think, report, and write across print, broadcast and  online media platforms&rdquo; , convergence is often a topic of debate more than it  is a teaching practice in today&rsquo;s journalism classrooms.  Further, in spite of the fact that many U.S.  newspapers and television stations have maintained an online presence for a  number of years now, some of the nation&rsquo;s journalism programs have not fully  embraced training journalism students to work in multiple-media platforms:  &ldquo;[W]ithin the walls of academia, this blending of media has not produced a revolution  of curriculum changes. In fact, as colleges and universities work to prepare  the next generation of journalists, what skills and knowledge they need to  compete in the modern media age—and who is going to teach them these skills and  share this knowledge—is a subject being debated more often than it&rsquo;s being  taught.&rdquo; <br>
    Among  the most basic of obstacles to incorporating convergence training across the  journalism curriculum is the reality that convergence continues to be an  elusive term that is used in various contexts and often ambiguous in its  definition.  Beyond this initial barrier,  some simply aren&rsquo;t quite ready for the full incorporation of convergence in the  curriculum for reasons associated with quality. Related to this, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  depleting journalism when you split up that [journalist&rsquo;s] focus&rdquo; by asking him  or her to perform multiple jobs, declares Healy. <br>
    Others,  meanwhile, fear that if convergence becomes the norm, many journalists might  &ldquo;become too busy to verify the information they find and resort to publishing  material supplied by professional spin-doctors&rdquo; or &ldquo;get so busy providing  content for multiple platforms that they simply do not have the time to reflect  or analyze&rdquo;.  Similarly, those within  Canada&rsquo;s Newspaper Guild also are concerned about convergence &ldquo;diluting&rdquo;  journalists&rsquo; work.  <br>
    In  looking at existing media outlets, another key issue surrounding convergence is  the need for a workable business model, with guidelines and maps for those  seeking to plan or implement any kind of multiple-platform publishing.  With no available models to call on,  convergence meets yet another roadblock. Moreover, in some areas, such as  Australia and New Zealand, another inhibitor to widespread convergence is  legislation that prohibits a company from owning both a television station and  a daily newspaper in the same media market. <br>
    Lastly,  cultural barriers also influence the rate of convergence in the workplace and  in the classroom.  Within a working  newsroom, for instance, there are multiple cultures; hence, when convergence is  employed, such as mixing traditional print journalists with broadcast  journalists or producers and on-air staff members, even more cultures are added  to the workplace environment. Consequently, when broadcast and print cultures  are intermingled in a single media environment, cultural barriers are  inevitable. <br>
    &ldquo;Convergence  actually increases the complexity of cultural relationships within a newsroom  within a company and within the corporate boardroom,&rdquo; observes Quinn, who notes  that differences in common language is another culturally based barrier that  divides print and broadcast journalists. <br>
    In  short, then,  differing attitudes about  convergence in the &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; of media organizations carry over to the  academy, where those who teach journalism also come from different areas of  journalistic specialization and hold area-specific allegiances to those  specializations; namely, print and broadcast. Not surprisingly, then, if there  is confusion about the widespread implementation of convergence within media  organizations, there also will be confusion surrounding the need to fully adopt  convergence into the undergraduate curricula.</p>
  <h2>Prior news habits research</h2>
  <p>Various  studies have examined mass media use by adults, and more specifically, college students.  However, because of rapid growth within the  electronic-media industry and the widespread accessibility of the Internet in  recent years, it is once more strategic and important to survey the  news-consumption habits among a college-age population. <br>
    Regarding  previous media use among the college-age audience, it has been suggested that  females tend to watch more television, read fewer newspapers and listen to the  radio more than males within the same age group.   Researchers also have indicated that as  education and income increase, so does newspaper reading but TV viewing  witnesses a notable decline.  Past  research also has suggested that newspapers were the No. 1 choice for local  news and detailed information, with television news being the overall top news  source choice for both national and international events among the college  audience.  Other related findings suggest  that, among this demographic, general media consumption and its perceived  importance increase with each year in college. <br>
    Most  recently, the findings of one news-related study indicated that (a) more  college graduates age 50 and younger connect to the Internet each day than  regularly view a network news broadcast and that (b) about 50 million Americans  utilize the Internet for news on a daily basis.   However, there remains ample room to learn more about Internet and  electronic media news sites in relation to undergraduates and their  news-reading habits.</p>
  <h2>Research Questions</h2>
  <p>•  How frequently do undergraduate students utilize traditional newspapers versus  Web-based news sites to acquire news?<br>
    •  What kinds of news (e.g., entertainment news, financial news, international  news, sports, etc.) is most commonly accessed by undergraduate news consumers?<br>
    •  Which online news sites do students most frequently access for news?<br>
    •  Which news sites do students consider to be most credible?<br>
    •  How often do undergraduate students engage in news-related media convergence?<br>
    •  Do interactive features associated with online news sites (e.g., videos or  slide shows) make consuming Web-based news more appealing to students?</p>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <p>This  study was approached using a mixed-methodology that employed a  researcher-designed questionnaire and focus groups. The participating  undergraduate completed a survey instrument composed of 27 Likert-scale and  multiple-choice questions. In addition to seeking basic demographic  information, the survey was designed to explore the news-reading habits of this  population, including frequency and consistency of use of a particular news medium. <br>
    Study  participants, all ages 18 and older, were enrolled a state-funded university  during the 2010 academic year. Convenience sampling was utilized to conduct the  research; participation was strictly voluntary, with no identifying information  sought. (Note: Because convenience sampling was utilized and the study was  conducted at only one university, the results obtained in such studies may be  generalized only to the population at large with great caution.)</p>
  <h1>Findings</h1>
  <p>A  total of 588 students completed the 27-item survey, which was administered by  the researcher in a campus-based classroom setting. Just more than half of the  respondents were female (54.4 percent, 320 total). A total of 263 (44.7  percent) were male; five respondents (.9 percent) did not indicate gender. <br>
    Regarding  age, the majority of survey participants (84.2 percent, 495 total) were age  18-24. Sixty-four students (10.9 percent) were age 25-30 and 14 participants  (2.4 percent) were age 31-37. Only four students (.7 percent) were age 38-44  and seven (1.2 percent) were age 45 or older. Four respondents did not report  an age. <br>
    Regarding  survey respondents&rsquo; grade classifications, 142 were freshmen, 121 were  sophomores, 147 were juniors and 169 were seniors at the time of the study.  Four students reported they were &ldquo;unsure&rdquo; of their grade classification; five  undergraduates did not respond to this question.</p>
  <h2>Undergraduates&rsquo; newspaper readership habits</h2>
  <p>According  to the survey results that focused on the frequency of newspaper readership,  only 42 of 588 respondents said they utilized traditional print, or the  newspaper, on a &ldquo;Daily&rdquo; basis as a news source. A total of 198 (33.7 percent)  reported they consulted a newspaper for information on a &ldquo;Weekly&rdquo; basis and 119  (20.2 percent) said they read a newspaper at least &ldquo;Monthly.&rdquo; Meanwhile, a  collective total of 227 respondents (38.6 percent) indicated they &ldquo;Rarely&rdquo; or  &ldquo;Never&rdquo; sought news via the traditional-print format.</p>
  <h2>Web-based new readership among undergraduates</h2>
  <p>Per  the survey results on frequency of news consumption as it relates to Web-based  news, 50 percent of respondents (294) said they &ldquo;Daily&rdquo; turned to Internet news  sites for information. Some 171 undergrads (29.1 percent) indicated they  utilized the Web for news &ldquo;Weekly&rdquo; and 69 respondents (11.7 percent) said they  sought online news on a &ldquo;Monthly&rdquo; basis. Collectively, 32 undergraduates (8.8  percent) reported they &ldquo;Never&rdquo; utilized the Internet to seek news.</p>
  <h2>Types of news sought</h2>
  <p>According  to this study&rsquo;s findings, the majority of students surveyed—70.2 percent—  indicated &ldquo;Local/ State News&rdquo; was the No. 1 type of news sought when they  turned to media for news information. The quest for &ldquo;National News&rdquo; was the No.  2-ranked type of news sought by respondents, with &ldquo;Traffic/Weather&rdquo; reports  listed as the next most-commonly sought type of news. Table 1 illustrates the  response breakdown, by news category, for this question.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>TABLE 3: Overview of Focus Group Participants</strong><br>
    <em>Note.</em> A total of 18 students participated in the focus groups. </p>
  <h2>Students&rsquo; views on credible Web-based news sites</h2>
  <p>During  the focus groups, several students, when interviewed about which websites  contained the most credible news reports, provided general viewpoints about  credibility as it relates to news versus identifying specific news outlets. The  following is a sampling of their responses.<br>
    Emily:  In this day and age, credible is hard to find. … I seek a variety of [news]  sources in hopes that, between them, I can figure out what actually happened.<br>
    Suzanne:  Credible sources are few and far between. Credible, to me, is as close to a  first-hand account as possible, and unbiased.<br>
    Michael:  Credible sources are those … that have proven themselves through many years of  [news] coverage. Websites that end in &ldquo;.org&rdquo; or &ldquo;.edu&rdquo; are also typically  credible.<br>
    James:  Credibility is a huge deal—especially online. Anyone can post anything, so I  have to make sure I&rsquo;m getting the information from a source that is usually  very unbiased and correct on their reports.<br>
    David:  Actually, I have a hard time with most news that I read. I feel there is always  bias one way or another, and I find it difficult to trust what I read in the  news. When it comes to credibility, I find that local news media to have an  advantage simply because the events that are covered are far less significant  that those listed on the major news sites. <br>
    Jessica:  Credible sources, for me, are the news websites [that are] television and  newspaper sites. The people that run these sites are trained in reporting, so  to me they are trustworthy.<br>
    Mark:  I believe that news sources, including TV, focus on events that will make  ratings go up rather than on news that is really important. For example, the  Tiger Woods sex scandal will bring in a larger … audience than health-care  issues will. This leaves me with a pessimistic outlook on news sources, whether  credible or not.<br>
    Richard:  Credible news sources, such as CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, always seem to have the  biggest reach. What I mean by that is they always seem to be the first places  to break the most current news. However, each organization puts its own spin on  the way the news is presented, so at times the only way to have any idea  [about] what&rsquo;s really going on is [to] check as many news sources as you  possibly can over the course of a couple of days.<br>
    The only problem  with news sources like this is that, while they do report on things that  actually matter, from time to time they will get stuck in a celebrity rut. I  personally don&rsquo;t care about things like the Tiger Woods scandal, and I don&rsquo;t  feel like anyone else should, either.</p>
  <h2>Undergraduates&rsquo; preferred websites for &lsquo;trustworthy&rsquo; news</h2>
  <p>Some  focus group participants—when interviewed further and asked to be more specific  in naming credible news sites—clearly identified particular Internet sources as  being trustworthy news sources. Moreover, a number of research participants  shared their views concerning why these news outlets were their preferred news  sources. A sampling of their responses follows.<br>
    Rhonda:  I use the Associated Press website, because they have the most up-to-date news  and, after all, we as Americans we all want the latest [news]. <br>
    Alexander:  I usually watch CNN or MSNBC every morning … but go to The New York Times&rsquo; site  for online news [because] it&rsquo;s easy to navigate.<br>
    Megan:  I mainly go to The New York Times site, but also visit CNN and The Los Angeles  Times [online]. They generally have the information I am looking for and seem  reliable to me. I like their Web layouts better [than other news sites] because  they&rsquo;re easy to navigate.<br>
    Emily:  I read online newspapers such as The New York Times and local papers. … I pick  these papers up in print forms occasionally, but the online versions are much  easier to access from anywhere. … I also read news at the CNN and Fox News  sites.<br>
    I love the literary quality of the  stories written for The New York Times. Most of them read like feature stories,  even when they are hard-news stories. I read local papers, because it&rsquo;s  important to know what&rsquo;s going on in one&rsquo;s own community. I check out the  broadcast companies because they always have interesting and usually  controversial things to say.<br>
    Aaron:  I would say I get 50 percent of my news online, local and national news, and 30  percent from print [sources] and 20 percent from radio, NPR (National Public  Radio).<br>
    Mary:  I get the majority of my news online and from traditional newspapers … so I can  know what&rsquo;s happening around the world.<br>
    Michael:  With free access to local, regional and national publications on … campus, I  get a small portion of my news from [traditional] print. The majority of my  news comes through the Internet [since] it&rsquo;s basically a one-stop-shop for all  things communication.  … <br>
    Jessica:  I like Yahoo! News, local newspaper websites, and one television news site, Fox  News. I feel like these news sites are reliable sources of information.<br>
    Richard:  A majority of my news comes from online sources or online versions of cable  [news] sources. …<br>
    Josh:  Online is where I get my news mostly. It is usually easier to access news on  the Internet, because it will always be there no matter what time it is. When I  seek news, I usually go to The New York Times. It&rsquo;s one of the first places  that come to mind when I want news, and I have a subscription [to the  newspaper&rsquo;s website].<br>
    Lacey:  I get most of my news from the Internet. I rarely watch TV and I never listen  to the radio. …<br>
    David:  I get the majority of my news online. For local news, I read The Tennessean  online; for national news, CNN.com and The Drudge Report  (www.drudgereport.com). … I like CNN but only because I feel like the other  major news networks don&rsquo;t have the user-friendly layout that CNN has.<br>
    Tim:  I prefer to get news from a traditional newspaper, but in actuality, I probably  get more news from online. Right now, there aren&rsquo;t any particular sites for  news that come to mind, except Fox News. I mean, I&rsquo;m not going to lie, I&rsquo;m  conservative, so I tend to like their reporting better. …<br>
    Gina:  My use of television and online [news sources] would run a close 1-2. Online, I  look to The New York Times, CNN.com, MSNBC.com, The Christian Science Monitor  and ESPN.com because frequent updates are easily accessed [on these sites] from  work or home.</p>
  <h2>Frequency of media convergence</h2>
  <p>Although  several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage  in media convergence, such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcasts that  accompanied an online story, as part of their Web-based news consumption, a  significant number of students indicated the interactive features often  associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to  them. <br>
    In  fact, 10 of the 17 students who actively discussed this question reported that,  overall, these &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; features caused the Internet news experience to be  &ldquo;more appealing,&rdquo; in addition to making Web-based news &ldquo;more relatable,&rdquo; among  other positives. Thus, such feedback suggests the majority of undergraduates  surveyed are, in fact, engaged in media convergence during their online-news  consumption. The following are among the students&rsquo; comments surrounding media convergence.<br>
    David:  I don&rsquo;t engage in media convergence on national or local news often, but I find  that I do interact far more with local sports news.<br>
    Josh:  I usually tend to read stories and move on unless whatever media convergence  available can offer more detail about a story I&rsquo;m interested in.<br>
    Gina:  I read some blogs and reader postings on websites. However, much [of the]  postings by nonprofessionals is dripping with venom and frequently adds nothing  but obscenity to the discussion. Therefore, I do not take postings by readers  very seriously and do not desire to waste time responding to their online  drivel.<br>
    Megan:  I read the text, watch videos and look at pictures but hardly listen to  anything online that&rsquo;s audio only, like podcasts.<br>
    James:  I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of media convergence. I&rsquo;m very interactive with news online  by commenting and reposting [news stories] for others to find.<br>
    Emily:  I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m interactive at all. I read stories and then move on. I never  comment or blog on those stories. I will talk about them with friends, but not  usually online. … Just reading about the tragedy in Haiti has brought me to  tears a couple times, so I don&rsquo;t want to see the trauma [via video or photos  online] as well.<br>
    Richard:  I generally don&rsquo;t interact with online media sources because I don&rsquo;t like the  anonymity of it. It&rsquo;s really hard to have a serious conversation or a  full-fledged debate about health-care reform or global warming with someone who  goes by the name &ldquo;JennyCat33&rdquo; or &ldquo;SkudTheStud.&rdquo; I prefer face-to-face  interactions. That&rsquo;s also why I tend to avoid posting on blogs, too.<br>
    Lacey:  I am not very interactive with online news. As far as media convergence goes, I  don&rsquo;t really view the videos that go along with a story because I would rather  read an article than watch a video.<br>
    Tim:  I think if the story really interested me, I might try to [utilize media  convergence] more, but I really just read the stories.<br>
    Michael:  Mostly, yes, I do engage in media convergence. I explore how advanced sites are  with multimedia. The New York Times has, in my opinion, the best multimedia  [such as] videography, audio and picture presentations, et cetera, of all the  American news sites I&rsquo;ve explored.</p>
  <h1>Discussion</h1>
  <p>In  a technology-driven media environment, journalism scholars and educators must  make time to &ldquo;stand back from the front line … and develop perspective on the  wider field [of contemporary journalism]&rdquo; for the purposes of better defining  journalism education and redesigning its curriculum to keep pace with today&rsquo;s  media platforms.  Although there is no  guaranteed prescription for the perfect journalism curricula, its educators  have a fundamental responsibility to review, evaluate and update how and what  they teach so their students are adequately prepared to work in an information  age where media convergence and journalistic cross-training is the norm.<br>
    In  the early 20th century, French statesman, journalist and teacher Georges  Clemenceau said, &ldquo;War is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the  military.&rdquo; Similarly, in the early 21st century it may be said that  &ldquo;Convergence is too important to be left to practitioners.&rdquo; Educators, instead,  must embrace these new technologies for the sake of their learners, as well as  for the sake of journalism education&rsquo;s future. Otherwise, students will lack  the necessary skills that are vital to the effective delivery of information  that is at the core of a democratic society.</p>
