  <p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
  <p>Everyone is  aware that Information Technology (IT)  has played a very significant role in taking businesses and educational  institutions to new heights. Before the advent of computers and relevant  technology, business and information management were totally done using manual  resources. As a result, the time taken to complete a task was more, quality of  work was not up to the mark, and the procedures also tended to be more  complicated (Rampur,2010). </p>
  <p>However, as  computers started to be used in business establishments, the processing of work  got more stabilized. These technologies are used in almost all sectors such as  accounts and payroll management, inventory management and  control, shipping functions, data  and database management, financial analysis, software development,  security control and many other essential fields. The end result of modern  computing is increased productivity and quality. </p>
  <p>Organizing and administering the  activities that normally occur in any day-to-day business office environment, a  repetitive manual task can be lessened significantly through the application of  technology. Management system is made up of people interacting with other  people and machines that, together, set the goals and objectives, outline the  strategies and tactics, and develop the plans, schedules and necessary controls  to run an organization (Genviere, 2009).</p>
  <p>Research Information System is a database storing data  on current research by organization and people, usually through some kind of  project activity. There is an increasing awareness of the need for quality  research management (information) system: for researchers: easy access to  relevant information and associated software, processor power, storage systems  and – where any necessary – detectors to collect more data to overcome  incomplete or inconsistent information for research and administrator:  easy measurement and analysis of research  activity and easy access to comparative information, for research councils:  optimization of funding process, for entrepreneurs and technology transfer  organizing: easy of retrieval of novel ideas and technology in a  knowledge-assisted environment, easy access to information, software and  computer power to allow easily-assimilated presentation of research results in  appropriate context.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Background  of the Study</strong></p>
  <p>The researchers studied the problems encountered by the  Research and Development Office concerning managing records of researches in  the university. It is much difficult for them to organize and find a specific  study or research every now and then. The researchers will find a solution for  this problem by creating a wed based application that will suite for the  clients need and for the benefits of the faculty and students conducting  researches.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Research Objectives</em></strong></p>
  <p>The study aims to develop an Online Research Access  Portal intended for the Research and Development Office of the Bulacan State  University </p>
  <p>Specifically, the study sought to </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Design  an online research access  portal to  manage researches</li>
    <li>Create  the online research access portal as designed</li>
    <li>Test  and evaluate the acceptability of the online research access portal</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
  <p><strong><em>Scope and Delimitations</em></strong></p>
  <p>The study is a development of an online research access  portal for the Bulacan State University&lsquo;s Research and Development Office.  The researchers considered several system  functionalities which were  incorporated  into the developed web-based portal as follows; user account for the Research  Director and Coordinators for every college, manage researches both for  students and faculty, uploading of thesis, journals and publications through  the online information system, filtering of records and report generation. The  membership is controlled by the administrator and only the research  coordinators of every college are given accounts and access to the internal  components of the portal while the viewing of the website can be access by the  public users. The system was evaluated by selected students, RDO staff,  selected research coordinators and IT experts. </p>
  <p><strong>METHODOLOGY</strong></p>
  <p>The study is an applied research wherein  a prototype of the system was developed, tested and evaluated. The development  was based on the assumption that the member colleges are equipped with the  necessary hardware for online communication.</p>
<p><strong><em>Project Design and Development</em></strong></p>
<p>The system is designed wherein the  research coordinators from different colleges can connectto the admin as shown  in the conceptual model in Figure 1. </p>

<p align="center">Figure 1. Conceptual Model of the  Online Research Access Portal<br>
  The figure shows  that different colleges connected to the system wherein they can submit necessary  research outputs such as student and faculty researches / journals while an  administrator manages the site. In this design the system is available to all  colleges of the university.</p>
<p>The system was analysed and designed by  employing the USE Case as shown in Figure 2. This is the design of the web portal  for each member college. This design is based on the function of the research  department in Bulacan State University including satellite campuses. The  Research and Development Office is under the office of a Vice President for  Research and Extension, and supervised by the Research Director. The university  is composed of different colleges; each college is represented by a Research Coordinator.  The Research Coordinator is responsible for submitting all the completed  student and faculty researches including title and the abstract.</p>
<p> The figure shows the different actors in the system,  the research director, the research coordinator and public user. As Research  Director, his/her access to the system are: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Browse  accomplished researches</li>
  <li>Manage  the Research coordinators information and account</li>
  <li>Post  events and announcements regarding research activities in their college or  university</li>
  <li>Send  private messages to  researcher  coordinators in the group</li>
  <li>Maintain  college or university researches / journals</li>
  <li>Manage  accomplishment reports </li>
  <li>Generate  Research reports</li>
</ol>
<p>The Research Coordinatoraccess to the  system includes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Submit  completed faculty and student Research/Journal</li>
  <li>Submit  Accomplishment Reports</li>
  <li>Browse  accomplished researches</li>

  The research coordinators can upload the  completed research of the student and faculty, the page is as shown in Figure  7. The title as well as the abstract  of  the completed research will be uploaded individually. Then it will be saved in  the research database of the system. </p>
<p>The system testing was done for a  duration of one semester (5 months) to ensure a very satisfactory outcome on  its functionality and reliability. In the state university where initial  evaluation was done, they rated the system &ldquo;very acceptable.&rdquo; The system had an  overall rate of &ldquo;Very satisfactory&rdquo; on its functionality and &ldquo;Very Acceptable&rdquo;  on its acceptability.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS  AND RECOMMENDATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Based on the results of the tests and  evaluation, it can be concluded that</p>
<ol>
  <li>An online research access portal for the  Research and Development Office of the Bulacan State University was designed  and created with the following features:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Interactive  interface with exclusive membership</li>
    <li>Well  organized management of research outputs </li>
    <li>Easy monitoring activities of research  outcomes in all member colleges</li>
  </ol>
  <li>The system was tested to be &ldquo;Very  Satisfactory&rdquo; and &ldquo;Very Acceptable.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the results and conclusions,  the following are recommended:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The system be fully implemented in the  state university were the research is conducted</li>
  <li>Adapt the same way of research output  management in other state university in the Philippines.</li>
  <li>Draw a policy plan for the full  implementation of the system.</li>
</ol>
