    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>Since  the nineteen seventies, Commercial banks in the financial innovation driven,  personal finance business has developed rapidly, the number of personal  financial products sales growth. The issuing scale size of personal finance  products of China's Bank in 2006 reached 400000000000 Yuan. However, from the  beginning of 2007, along with the financial industry opening to foreign  financial institutions, domestic commercial bank financial business was badly  affected, the financial products of domestic commercial banks are lack of  diversity and hierarchical, product information asymmetry, the lack of  independent innovation ability and so on slowly highlights. As a new rising  branch of Chinese city commercial banks industry, its financial aspects should  be strengthened. This paper focuses on the problems and the reasons for City  Commercial Bank in China in the aspects of financial products, puts forward  effective countermeasures.</p>
    <h1>Existing problems of personal finance products of City Commercial  Banks</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Market segmentation and hierarchical service of financial products  are still need to be improved are Domestic commercial banks developed much  market segmentations focusing on income, family and life cycle, which is  single. In fact, you can also press demographic segmentation, comprehensive  demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, occupation and family  life cycle stage to divide the market. Generally speaking, customer market  segmentation not only to distinguish between different consumer value-added  services, such as hedging, steady or risk type, and analysis of their social  class, property, income scale, credit rating, risk tolerance, buying behavior  and habits etc.. City Commercial Bank financial products is almost rely on the  counter sales, the lack of other sales methods, is not able to provide direct  and convenient way for customers to purchase, the product sales have been great  limitation. </li>
      <li>The product of a single, homogeneous phenomenon is serious, similar  products are much. At present our country Commercial Bank launched products  mostly just the original bank deposit, loan products and intermediate business  products re combination, mostly concentrated in personal credit, debit and  credit, information services and other basic financial products. And the city  commercial banks because of its smaller, due to lack of R &amp; D, quantity is  little, such as Bank of Chongqing, now only a few financial products. The  Chongqing Bank launched the &quot;week business&quot; in the case, for a period  of 7 days, to contract customers cycle management. The financial product  initial purchase amount is 50000 yuan, signed by the customer to buy financial  products after the agreement is signed, since the day the system automatically  according to the agreement between the methods and the amount of buckle draw a  financial funds to finance accounts every day, automatic management. The  biggest feature is the automatic cycle of financial management, with the use  with the check and the power of compound interest. Liquidity is not only demand  deposits, and demand deposits interest rates 4 times the fiscal revenue, is  actually a re packaging to bank 7 days notice deposit. Currently on the market  similar products are the China Everbright Bank &quot;sunshine finance week  plan&quot;, Minsheng Bank &quot;money&quot; financial B account, to pay the  &quot;Shuangli management accounts&quot; etc.. For this kind of financial  products, banks operating technique is almost exactly the same, will raise  funds on the interbank bond market, make some gains by buying bonds, bills,  bonds and other bonds denominated in RMB. This operation technique arbitrages  through the deposit interest rates far below the inter-bank market investment .  At the same time, the RMB financial products in the timing convergence in  abnormal, the target customer group selection is also focused on the city elite.  This consistent pattern makes the RMB financial products homogenization  phenomenon banks interbank seriously, this financial products competition can  only rely on improving product sales to achieve better returns to the bank, its  profit space has been squeezed more and more small, thereby into a passive situation in business development.</li>
      <li>Personal  finance product marketing is lack of overall planning and creativity, marketing  ideas are behind. Personal finance product varieties of domestic commercial banks  are convergence, price competition is intense. But the marketing planning is  not of importance and creative. But now the marketing behavior of many  commercial banks personal financial products is the same, many banks are eager  to seize market share, pre work product marketing is not perfect, not deep  enough for localization, and sometimes are not clear whether they are suitable  to launch a product, anxious to compete with other banks, the marketing effect  doesn&rsquo;t work as well as they&rsquo;d hoped. </li>
      <li>Marketing personnel quality is  not high, the incentive mechanism is not perfect, prone to moral hazard&ldquo;2008</li>
      <li>. City Commercial Bank financial business started late, had a low  starting point. Marketing personnel training and incentive mechanism are not as  good as the foreign banks. The city commercial banks occupied the market share  through the sale of financial products , led to the marketing personnel  performance pressure, the sales staff is  prone to moral hazard. For example, only emphasize financial products income,  do not talk about risk, exaggerated &quot;the highest yield, and the emergence  of the&quot; high risk &quot;not floating benefit&quot; products sold to the  kind of risk averse clients like the retired , the reputation and credibility  of banks were hurt hardly. In 2008 April, the CBRC has informed the part of  commercial bank financial products problems, said: &quot;part of the commercial  banks do not accurately understand the client's financial situation, investment  objectives, investment experience and risk perception and ability; not evaluate  whether it is suitable for the client to purchase the recommended products, and  will inform the customer about the evaluation opinions.&quot; </li>
      <li>Brand building is not  perfect, the brand value cannot be reflected Domestic joint-stock commercial  banks in personal financial product brand construction in the forefront, the  merchants bank &quot;golden sunflower&quot; series, the Minsheng Bank's  &quot;extraordinary&quot; series, the Everbright Bank's &quot;sunshine&quot;  series have been known and understood through the good marketing . City  Commercial Bank is limited by its smaller size, for financial products in the  promotion is smaller. Even in the local, financial products, influence and  recognition is also much lower than the brand construction of joint-stock  commercial banks. Some of the time, the quality of the products is better than  that of joint-stock commercial banks circumstances, product sales is still far  lower than the same period in the same type of joint-stock bank financing  products. The emergence of &quot;a difficult situation with no one knows&quot;</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Analysis of the Cause of the Problem</h1>
    <h2>Analysis of the causes of market segmentation and hierarchical  service defects of financial products.</h2>
    <p>In  the beginning ,the market positioning of City Commercial Banks is &quot;service  to serve the local economy, small and medium-sized enterprises, service city  residents&quot;, not paying enough attention to the development of the  intermediate services including personal financial business. Financial products  in the domestic appeared even before some city commercial banks set up time.  The city commercial banks will be more focus on traditional banking services,  financial management products for market segmentation and hierarchical service  input is far less than other commercial banks. In the hierarchical service  financial products is subject to the small scale, insufficient number of  employees, not the shunt more hands to support financial products promotion and  sales of the original transactions and customer manager, as a professional  financial account manager. More is to choose the counter operation personnel to  carry out financial products marketing and sales integration type sales model.</p>
    <h2>Financial products are single, analysis of the causes of serious  homogenization phenomenon.</h2>
    <p>The  city commercial banks personal fi nancial market practice time is short,  financial engineering talent is useless, do  not know enough about the individual customer's actual financial needs and risk  preferences, coupled with the current financial separate operation of banking  financial products investment limits in the field of personal financial  products, so that commercial banks now launched relatively relatively simple,  relatively similar varieties. Although the financial products of domestic  commercial banks development has reached a certain scale, especially have  absolute predominance in the RMB financial products, but from the personal  financial product development and profitability, Chinese banks are still  insufficient, the product quantity to be huge, but the actual species  homogenization of serious, especially in domestic small and medium-sized city  commercial banks, it is in order to re packaging products joint-stock banks  mature. Listed in 2007 to purchase new financial products and asset management  products, together with the credit assets as the foundation, is the domestic  commercial banks follow the simple imitation. In product development aspect,  city commercial banks, as small banks ,copy other domestic commercial bank products  as the main mode of product development at the present stage.</p>
    <h2>Analysis of the causes of financial products marketing ideas  behind.</h2>
    <p>&ldquo;Marketing  concept to customer demand as the center&quot; marketing concept is not deep  into our city commercial bank's financial products, as the marketing to sell,  that sporadic use advertising, promotional strategy is the marketing. Not  really aware of the importance of customer needs; lack of emerging market  consciousness, provides the high quality door to door service for the customer  less,  still using  the kind of &quot;waiting&quot; approach,  ignore the research and development of potential customers. These backward  marketing concept leads to excessive bank client focused on direct interest and  immediate interests, ignoring the long-term and comprehensive development. Only  pay attention to seize the existing customers and the market, ignoring the  existence and value of potential customers, the lack of overall planning for  the focus on marketing strategy and the development direction of the current.</p>
    <h2>Analysis of the causes of  financial  products marketing personnel quality is not high..</h2>
    <p>In  the commercial bank, the production department of financial management products  belongs to the financial markets department, also known as the Treasury  Department, the Department in the head office directly on the personal  financial business is in charge of the vice president. Financial products sales  department is personal financial department, financial management division, the  lobby manager belong to personal finance ministry, who exists in each branch,  branch of a large number of. Although before each product was push-off,  designers of  the market financial  products are responsible for the training of personal financial department to  the main product sales, design concept, mode of operation and risk products.  But the personal financial products are not only relate to the basic business  bank, more requirements in the financial products marketing personnel should  possess the qualities of professionalism and the financial industry. Personal  finance manager of commercial banks in China are mostly from the temporary  staff training from the cabinet, they know very little about product  development ideas and personal financial products operation knowledge, their  understandings of personal financial products and financial comprehensive  quality is also difficult to adapt to the increasingly specialized, complicated  personal finance product marketing requirements, not conducive to personal  financial product marketing..</p>
    <h2>Analysis of cause of financial products brand building is not  perfect, brand value can not be reflected.</h2>
    <p>Because  of its strong local characteristics, scale is small, local government  investment background and other defects, even if there are some city commercial  bank have some knowledge of financial products brand on the necessity and  importance, but City commercial banks are far less than large state-owned  commercial banks and joint-stock commercial banks in the understanding and  attention degree. Brand building is more rely on traditional propaganda like  mouth to mouth of the city residents because of quality products. Its brand  promotion is not as good as the large state-owned commercial banks and  joint-stock commercial banks in the depth and breadth,. With the major  joint-stock commercial banks, whose domestic financial brand promotion is outstanding,  in the competition, even if the product is better than the same type of  joint-stock bank products, but still at a disadvantage in the purchase amount.</p>
    <h1>Advice of Optimizing city commercial banks personal financial  product</h1>

Through the establishment of data warehouse of large, large  customer data to accumulate in the banks using the advanced data warehouse and  data mining technology, according to the age, occupation, income, investment  experience and other re classification, starting from the aspects of its trade  preferences, induction, analysis, comprehensive analysis, reveal the actual  demand characteristics. According to the characteristics of the personal  financial management business of city commercial banks, and the local actual  situation, city commercial banks has three elements of market segmentation according  to the interest, the population and the psychological. From the interest  factors that benefit pursuit, orientation is different, different human pursuit  of interests willing to bear the risk degree is different, specific financial  products, the tendency is different. From the population factors, people in  different age, because they have different concepts of life, consumption  concept and life experience, the risks and benefits of the different attitude.  From the psychological factors, different people have different life and mode  of spending time and money, and different people accept different degrees of  financial products and these actual market demands are closely related to  financial products. City Commercial Banks on the basis of but not limited to  these three elements, can be successfully put the customer market segmentation  into several different sub markets, including any sub market have similar needs  of target customers. City commercial banks can be reasonably according to the  market environment, its resources and business characteristics, select the  target customers, and target market selection, according to different customer&rsquo;s  different needs of financial products, to provide different financial products  for customers to design different levels.</p>
    <h2>On the customer segmentation, provide the service level for  different customer needs.</h2>
    <p>Hierarchical  service does not represent a discriminatory service or only provides the  service for the customers. Due to the different target groups of clients with  different personal financial product demand, city commercial banks shall,  according to their actual financial needs, combined with their contributions to  the banks, to provide differentiated services for different levels of  customers, in favor of personal financial products and the increase of bank  profit. At present, China's large commercial banks in the personal finance is  mainly for high-end customers, through the introduction of various types of  silver card, gold card, platina card, VIP card, VIP plan, set up financial  studio, providing exclusive privilege and the opening of the corresponding fast  service channels and other measures for VIP customers, realize the special  service to the customers. But the large commercial banks ignored the other  numerous, in marketing also mostly high-end customers, not for personal finance  customer knowledge, even never heard. Therefore, city commercial banks can jump  out of fierce competition for high-end customer markets, into the vast blue sea  and customer management. Small and medium-sized customers are the city  commercial bank's basic customer group. At the same time, the national social  security system, medical care system, education system reform also causes  people to pay more attention to your financial status. Through the reasonable  financing plan, ensure their future life in financial security and independence  to independent, objective, the basic target that the people pursue has become  better enjoy life. The rapid expansion of the middle class and the urban residents'  income growth provides a broad market for city commercial banks. An average  annual growth of 30% financial needs, but also requirements of city commercial  bank must give full play to their own advantages, the segmentation of target  market, small and medium-sized customer management market force.</p>
    <h2>The development of new products should be based on &quot;customer  satisfaction&quot; principle.</h2>
    <p>As  China's financial market is opening to foreign banks, financial product market  competition will be more intense. Chinese banks, foreign banks through mutual  participation and M &amp; A, not only make their own capital gained rapid  promotion, more make the service levels continue to improve, especially in the  development of personal financial products, more to be way ahead in city commercial  banks. Furthermore the earliest personal financial products of the joint-stock  commercial bank financial products are more abundant and diverse; the  marginalized position of city commercial banks is more serious. City Commercial  Bank must identify the target customers, through the continuous development in  line with the actual needs of target customers, with its own characteristics of  the financial products, and constantly open up the market, and their market  share gradually stabilized, in order to better survival and development in the  fierce competition in the market. Although the ultimate goal of city commercial  banks to develop personal financial business is to increase income, improve the  level of profitability, but the short-term goal should be to &quot;customer  satisfaction, capital preservation profit&quot; principle for the development  of financial products. One is to retain customers, city commercial bank staff  and customer relationship is close, easy to make the customer dependence. If  the city commercial banks to personal financial products to customer assets  reasonably stable, reflecting a certain strength from two aspects of marketing  services and the quality of the products, not only can make banks more closely  relationship with customers, improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, and  ultimately to retain customers purpose; two is through the new financial  product later independent research and development of the personal assets, meet  customer demand, outside the city commercial banks to give customers a  &quot;financial ability&quot; impression, and attract growing customer; three  is a typical set of personal financial products, enlarge the potential  customers, through existing customers and marketing their own levels continue  to rise, to improve the quality of the products, drive more potential customers  to participate in the personal financial management business, to tap its full  potential; four is the client steadily increase or decrease based on speed  loss, financial product innovation with local characteristics, to meet the high  quality financial needs of customers, so that the city commercial banks have  gradually &quot;boutique banks&quot; road.</p>
    <h2>Create the financial elite management team.</h2>
    <p>Bank  financing is a strange and frightening concept of city commercial banks,  horrible lies in the lack of financial backbone -- financial talents. Create  elite management team has become a pressing matter of the moment of city  commercial banks. First, personnel training. Our financial adviser and  development is accompanied by the sustained growth of national wealth. In order  to adapt quickly to the growing financial needs, develop domestic qualified  management experts, published in 2003, the national Ministry of labor and  social security of the fifth batch of 53 occupation standard, financial  management division was formally incorporated into the national occupation  ceremony. In December 11, 2004, the Chinese financial education development  foundation Financial Planning Standards Board passed the &quot;Interim Measures  for the financial planner certification&quot;. China Institute of Certified  Financial Planners (The Chinese Institute of Certified Financial Planners,  referred to as: CICFP) was established in 2005, is China's financial management  division fast training, laid the foundation for growth. City commercial banks  must catch the bus, to speed up the training of financial personnel. Second,  long talent. Talent is the core competitiveness of modern social organization.  The former Citibank CEO Gao Tillman Rockefeller pointed out in 1965: &quot;if  we have done in the last few years things all down, and then put them back  together, then we can see, for so many years, we have the most energy, spent  most of the time, and will continue to do so thing is -- people's problems, on  this point should be no doubt. In Citibank, staff recruitment, hiring,  training, staffing and development is always in the first row.&quot;  &quot;Reuse talent, talent, talent award, long talent&quot; is to select  talents Citibank outlook. Success is the modern bank. Chinese city commercial  banks to make his team into the elite team, strive for in the financial markets  rely on superior force, strong onslaught, maximize financial market share.  Cultivation of talent, talent is the key to the success of a long stay.</p>
    <h2>Carefully build financial products brand, achieve financial  products brand loyalty.</h2>
    <p>City  commercial banks to talent showing itself in the fierce market competition,  must have their own brand. As the competition among today's enterprises more  and more fierce, &quot;wine is also afraid of deep alley&quot;. So the city  commercial banks to design a good product, must use of television, radio,  movies and other media, to strengthen publicity and breadth of financial  products, to enable more customers to understand it, set a powerful, full range,  multi function for city commercial banks personal financial products and  service provider the image, in order to stimulate customer consumption desire.  Brand is an asset, but the real assets is the consumer brand loyalty. The  United States of America, Professor Telunxi Shimp mentioned &quot;brand is not  an asset in his monograph about integrated marketing communication, brand  loyalty is the asset. No customer loyalty, the brand is purely a trademark, is  a kind of symbol can be owned, recognizable, but it has no value.&quot; Brand  awareness can be created, as long as the financial industry brand invested  large amounts of funds for the brand promotion, brand awareness in a short  period of time can quickly realize. However, consumer loyalty to the financial  industry brand, from brand consumption in the process of accumulation of  service satisfaction. City commercial banks through advertising, publicity,  sales promotion to build up &quot;the brand&quot;, must careful maintenance, to  meet the consumer's cognition, so as to keep the brand image consistent, only  to consumers of products, services and brands are satisfied, can eventually  build customer loyalty.</p>
