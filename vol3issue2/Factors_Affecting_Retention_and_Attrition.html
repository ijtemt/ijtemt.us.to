</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The main objective of  the study is to determine the factors affecting retention and attrition rates  at La Consolacion University Philippines. Findings of the study revealed that  LCUP experienced a downtrend in enrolment from school year 2009-2010 to  2012-2013 during the 1st and 2nd semesters of the school years 2009-2010,  2010-2011, and 2011-2012, respectively. However, during the school year  2012-2013, LCUP gained an additional of 183 students in the first semester, 252  in the second semester, and 112 in summer, respectively. The identified factors  affecting attrition and retention rates such as the first year transition,  academic advising, career planning and placement, learning assistance/academic  support, mentoring, faculty development, financial aid, co-curricular programs  and other services if not given enough attention could have a major effect in  the enrolment statistics of the university. Hopes for higher retention rates  are reliant on the concerted efforts between academic and administrative units,  as well as on individual faculty members and academic support group.<br>

  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>Retention  among students has become a challenging concern for the academic community. It  refers to students&rsquo; continued study until successful completion (Fowler and  Luna, 2009) and is one of the most widely studied areas in higher education  (Powell, 2009).<br>
    Private higher education institutions  (HEIs) are aware of the importance of student retention issue because students&rsquo;  experience is a tangible demonstration of the validity and meaning of  institutional mission (Scholder and Maguire, 2009). Hence, soliciting feedbacks  from students is necessary to assess retention factors about specifics areas of  the institution like value, resources, academics, faculty, advising/supporting  services, social life, extracurricular activities, educational goals and  preparation for the future. <br>
    There are variety of reasons that the  higher education is increasingly emphasizing persistence rates covering  financial demands, reputation enhancements, and perceived advantages in  admission. However, the student persistence in national rate and graduation has  shown little change over the past decade (NCES, 2005). Some institutions are  starting to assign responsibility for retention to the chief enrollment  officer, whereas others assign this responsibility to student affairs staff  (Scholder and Maguire, 2009).<br>
    Alkandari (2008) explained that  achieving personal aspiration and academic merit, getting jobs, acquiring  social class, getting jobs, developing skills, high standard status of the  school, and feeling that one belongs to the university are factors affecting  students&rsquo; retention; and to work toward increasing student retention in higher  education institutions, administrators have the accountability of providing  students with an effective academic and non-academic environment that will  positively motivate students to persist with their studies and achieve  desirable progress in developing their personalities. This was affirmed by  Madgett and Belanger (2008) that there are numerous determinants influencing a  student&rsquo;s decision to stay or to drop out: economic factors, academic  difficulties and dissatisfaction, low GPA, poor advising and teaching, family  responsibilities, personal problems, enrollment at another school, and  dissatisfaction with residence living; and these indicators influence the  portion of the student&rsquo;s satisfaction with linkages relating to a student&rsquo;s  sense of belonging and participation in a quality education (Elliot, 2002).  Swail et al., (2003) asserted that social factors like financial issues,  attitude toward learning, attitude toward others, educational legacy, religious  setting, cultural values, goal commitment, family and peer influence and social  routine are essential in increasing students&rsquo; persistence. Extensive and steady  evidence supports that students&rsquo; grades, achievement, or academic performance  have an overpowering impact on persistence; and students from families with  larger incomes tend to persist more than students from families with lower  incomes (St. John, et al., 2001). In order to reduce the income constraints on  student educational pursuits, financial aid has played a critical role. In the  research of Bettinger (2004), it was revealed that the receipt of financial aid  had a positive impact on students&rsquo; persistence, especially when aid is in the  form of grants or scholarships.<br>
    Strauss and Volkwein  (2004) pointed out that behavioral intentions, attitudes toward higher  education, goal and institutional commitments, social and academic  interactions, and institutional &ldquo;fit&rdquo; are qualitative aspects of students&rsquo;  attrition.<br>
    Needless to say,  students&rsquo; satisfaction is a key component of demonstrating institutional  effectiveness; and students who stay in school despite relatively low levels of  satisfaction are not only at risk of becoming less than supportive alumni, but  may also actually be proactive in spreading their negative opinions of the  institution. Lau (2003) explained that students who are satisfied with the  formal and informal academic and social systems in a college or university tend  to stay in school; on the other hand, students who have unconstructive  interactions and experiences have a tendency to turn into disillusioned with  college, withdraw from their peers and faculty members and ultimately from the  institution. In fact, Bay and Daniel (2001) stressed that institutions of  higher education should not consider the student as the &ldquo;customer&rdquo; instead as  &ldquo;collaborative partner.&rdquo; Viewing the student as a partner rather than a  customer allows for the detection of a multifaceted relationship between the  student and the institution and may be effective in informing efforts to  improve that connection not only during recruitment, but during the entire  period in which the student is enrolled and beyond.<br>
    It is for this reason  that the factors affecting retention and attrition rates at LCUP utilizing  students&rsquo; experiences was evaluated in aid of drawing policy implications that  will improve the program viability of the university.</p>
  <h1>Related Literature</h1>
  <p>In  the study of Hsu and Bailey (2011), they found that a significantly higher  percentage of students who said they would not come back the following semester  indicated that their mentor was less willing to answer their queries and were  much less satisfied with the support from their advisor. Furthermore, other  factors like having intricacies with some aspects of college life such as being  gone from home, adjusting to dorm life, and encountering challenges in  maintaining relationships with persons from home were the indicators of  retention for the students. Research by Hendel (2007) showed that the first  year seminar did not increase the probability of retention; only high school  rank was a significant contributor of freshmen to sophomore retention. Same  study revealed that the students who participated in the first year discussion  group had experienced a greater sense of community during their first year  which may contribute to retention into a second year.<br>
    Waning number of  students returning to school usually results in larger financial loss and a  lower graduation rate for institution and might affect the perception of the  parents, students, stakeholders, legislators&rsquo; vision of the institution (Lau,  2003). Consequently an effective program for student retention is through  providing them with a meaningful learning environment, so that these students  will become connected to the institution by developing a sense of belonging  within the student body. Fowler and Boylan (2010) recommended that improving  student success and retention may be achieved if developmental educators also  address non academic and personal factors related to student success like clear  student guidelines, integrating first year transition coursework, intrusive  academic advising to treat the non academic and personal factors, and  traditional developmental education coursework and tutoring to address academic  factors. Lotkowski, et al., (2004) agree that students may be at higher risk of  dropping out if only the academic factors are addressed. Students&rsquo; academic  achievement is central to the institution because it demonstrates the  accomplishment of its mission to educate and prepare students for life beyond  college (Kim, et al., 2010). Drop out may point to an institution&rsquo;s lack of  awareness to meeting student needs, a failure to prepare and support student  progress, also, in realistic sense, create a financial debit to the institution  by losing a paying consumer (Kim, et al., 2010). On the other hand, according  to Mbuva (2011), sympathetic staffs, focusing on students&rsquo; individual and  academic needs, and positive modeling, improve student retention. Some  universities have integrated &ldquo;freshman seminar&rdquo; or &ldquo;experience&rdquo; courses into  their academic programs to augment retention of first year students  (Braunstein, et al., 2006).<br>
    The  purpose of this study was to examine student retention in the basic education  department, college programs and graduate school courses in La Consolacion  University Philippines, how the university retained students.</p>
  <h1>Ease of Use</h1>
  <p>The  main objective of the study is to determine the factors affecting retention and  attrition rates at La Consolacion University Philippines. Specifically, it aims  to:</p>
  <h2>Analyze the enrolment trend from 2009-2010 to 2012-2013 across  departments;</h2>
  <h2>Identify the factors affecting  student attrition and retention rates; </h2>
  <h1>Materials and Methods</h1>
  <p><strong>Methods and Techniques.</strong>          The study utilized the descriptive evaluation method of  research in determining the factors affecting students&rsquo; retention and attrition  rates at La Consolacion University Philippines. The students were asked to  identify factors that would have a major effect on their decision to leave  (attrition) and factors that would have a major contribution of staying  (retention) at LCUP. Nieswiadomy (2008) contends that it is an investigation in  which self-report data are collected from samples with the purpose of  describing populations on some variable or variables of interest. <br>
    <strong>Population and Sample of the Study.</strong> The respondents of the  study were 684 students of the nine academic departments of La Consolacion  University Philippines. The respondents in different departments are as  follows: Graduate School (39), College of Allied Medical Sciences (46), College  of Liberal Arts (20), College of Education (12), College of Information,  Technology and Education (59), College of Hospitality Management (83), College  of Business Administration76), Alternative Learning System70), and Basic  Education Department (279).<br>
    Simple random sampling  through the use of a table of random numbers was utilized in selecting the  respondents. According to Nieswiadomy (2008), it is a type of probability  sampling that ensures each element of the population has an equal and  independent chance of being chosen. The researcher first assigned a number to  each element of the accessible population. The table of random numbers was  entered at an arbitrary or random starting point. Selection was made by closing  the eyes and blindly point to a number in the table until the targeted sample  size was reached.<br>
    <strong>Instrument of the Study.</strong> The instrument that was  used in the study was adopted from ACT (2010) National Survey on &ldquo;What Works in  Student Retention&rdquo;. The instrument is composed of two parts. Part one shows the  factors affecting student attrition at LCUP.

    <strong>Data Gathering Procedures.</strong> The mode of data  gathering used was the questionnaire method.   Each of the respondents was given a close-ended structured set of  questions.  <br>
    In gathering the data,  the researcher carried out the following procedures:<br>
    1.A  letter was sent to the University President asking permission to conduct the  study. <br>

  <h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
  <p><strong>Enrollment Rate from School Year  2009-2010 to 2012-2013</strong><br>
    Increasing students&rsquo;  retention is becoming a significant issue in most higher education  institutions, specifically for the institutions that face an enrolment  downtrend. Barefoot (2004) stated that most private universities face a higher  rate of student attrition as seen in their enrolment statistics. For some  universities, this issue may negatively affect their economic level, whereas  students&rsquo; fees and tuitions increase the financial revenue of the institution.<br>
    A closer look at the  enrolment trend of LCUP from school year 2009-2010 to 2012-2013 would show that  the school experienced enrolment downtrend during the 1st and 2nd semesters of  the school years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012, respectively. During the  school year 2012-2013, LCUP gained an additional of 183 students in the first  semester, 252 in the second semester, and 112 in summer, respectively.<br>
    Further analysis of  the enrolment statistics in Figures 2, 3, and 4 revealed that downtrend of  enrolment is very evident in the three colleges namely College of Allied  Medical Sciences, College of Education, and Graduate school department.</p>

    One  of the hypothesized causes of downtrend in enrolment is the inability of the  university to retain students. To work toward increasing student retention,  administrators have the responsibility of providing students with an effective  academic and non-academic environment that will positively motivate students to  persist with their studies and achieve desirable progress in developing their  personalities. Providing students with multiple and effective services is a  significant element to increase student retention.<br>
    <strong>Factors  Affecting Attrition Rates at LCUP</strong><br>
    Elliott (2002) discovered  that there are several determinants influencing students&rsquo; decision to drop-out  such as but not limited to economic factors, enrollment at another school,  academic difficulties, family responsibilities, personal problems,  dissatisfaction with residence living, academic dissatisfaction, low GPA, and  poor advising or teaching.<br>
    In the case of La  Consolacion University Philippines, students expressed several possible reasons  of leaving the institution. As seen in Table 1, students identified top 10 factors  that will have a major effect on the attrition rate at LCUP. These indicators  if not well provided or attended to would also have a major effect in the  enrolment statistics of the university. Emerged as top reasons of leaving the  school are unmet students&rsquo; educational aspirations and goals (3.67) and  underdeveloped students&rsquo; study skills (3.67).   The aspiration to obtain a degree is perceived as a significant  contributing factor that affects the students&rsquo; decision to persist in their  studies; this reflects that the students firmly believed a university degree  was crucial to achieve their purpose in life following their education. This  finding was supported by Watson, Johnson, and Austin (2004), who stated that  some first year students reported that they continued their education to  achieve personal inspiration. Students considering dropping out are usually  having problems integrating into academic and/or social systems. In addition,  students who are unsure and do consider leaving their universities are not  confident in their decisions to undertake their studies.<br>
    Moreover, study skills  are a vital factor in increasing academic integration as well as academic  performance. According to Swail (2003), if the student has a full load (five  courses), he/she should spend at least one hour of homework for every hour in  the classroom. It was found out that studying for at least 15 hours (compared  to studying less) have a greater effect on students&rsquo; GPA, thereby increasing  his/her persistence. The function of the deans and professors is important in  ensuring that students are given enough homework for every coursework to ensure  that students are academically engaged.<br>
    Non-provision of the  following may result in possible dropping out of LCUP students: student engagement  opportunities in the classroom (3.64), quality of interaction between faculty  and students (3.63), and adequate academic/learning support services (3.61).  This is an area where the satisfaction of students to the quality of services  being offered by teaching and non-teaching personnel are expressed in terms of  productive and quality interaction between students and LCUP personnel namely  the professors and deans, as well as the frontliners from the student services,  guidance, admission, finance, registrar, among other. Although most students  are initially placed into developmental education courses through the scores  earned on placement test, Boylan (2009) argued that tests evaluate only their  academic (cognitive) abilities. Another important aspect of school service is  the non-academic (affective) factors especially for students with weak academic  skills.</p>

  <p align="center"><strong>TABLE 1: Top 10 Factors Affecting Attrition Rate at LCUP</strong><br>
    It  may be worthwhile to note that non-existence of the following provisions may  contribute a major effect on students&rsquo; attrition:  level of academic advisors&rsquo; concern for  students, students&rsquo; personal coping skills, accuracy of information provided by  academic advisors, level of certainty about career goals, and level of  emotional support from family, friends, and significant others.<br>
    <strong>Factors  Affecting Retention Rates at LCUP</strong><br>
    The social structure is influenced by  some of the following factors that are crucial in increasing students&rsquo;  retention (Swail et al, 2003): financial issues, educational legacy, attitude  toward learning, religious background, maturity, social coping skills,  communication skills, attitude toward others, cultural values, expectations,  goal commitment, family influence, peer influence and social lifestyle. This  study assessed the factors affecting students&rsquo; retention in the light of the  following dimensions: first year transitions, academic advising, career  planning and placement, learning assistance/academic support, mentoring,  faculty development, financial aid, co-curricular services/programs for  specific student sub-populations, and other activities/programs.<br>
    First year Transition. Some of the  influences affecting students&rsquo; retention are linked to positive occurrences and  experiences during the first year after enrolment for which organizational can  be demonstrated through an institution&rsquo;s policies and programs (Braxton and  McClendon, 2001). It may be gleaned from the data in table 2 that freshman  seminar (3.78), summer orientation (3.71), and parent/family orientation are  the identified top three factors affecting students&rsquo; retention at LCUP. These activities  are very helpful in alleviating the social, emotional and academic strains  experienced by students. Seminar and orientation given to students when done  religiously can better manage the first university experience, particularly for  higher-risk students. As noted by Belanger, Mount and Wilson (2002), happy  students are propagators of good news while unhappy students have a propensity  to drop out and to affect institutional image and finances negatively.</p>

  <p><strong>Academic Advising.</strong> According to Vander  Schee, 2007), academic advising is a &ldquo;process –oriented relationship&rdquo; between  the student and advisor in which the main focus is the student&rsquo;s ultimate  goals. Advising focuses on the growth of the student, instilling an &ldquo;awareness  of the relationship between education and life, the ability to set realistic  academic career goals as well as program to achieve them, and an awareness of  life extending beyond the college years. The student uses the advisor as a  resource whereby the students and advisor act in a problem solving role together.  The data in Table 3 show that in terms of academic advising, students  identified the top three major contributory factors to retention rates at LCUP  to wit: training for faculty academic advisors (3.93), values assessment  (3.90), and personality assessment (3.89). The relationship being built in  academic advising also focuses on &ldquo;academic competence, personal connection,  and increasing or validating life purpose,&rdquo; all of which are related with  academic success.

    In  addition, passing required credits would greatly motivate students to continue  their studies. This study suggests the importance of quality instruction and  valid assessment techniques that meet different intellectual skills of the  students. For instance, some students prefer essay exams; however, some may  prefer objective exams, which include multiple choice or true and false questions.<br>
    Further, the use of varied and  innovative teaching and learning methodologies is afactor in developing  intellectual skills. A good faculty member should be an educator who  understands students&rsquo; personal differences and use teaching methods that positively  affect student learning and success.<br>
    <strong>Financial  Aid</strong>. In terms of financial aid, major contributions to students&rsquo; retention  are pre-enrollment financial advising (3.76), short-term loans (3.61), and  workshops in money management (3.57)</p>

    In  addition to the previous factors that contribute to increasing students&rsquo;  retention at the university, some students indicated that attending that  attending different kinds of extracurricular activities, such as exhibitions,  seminars, poetry presentation, cultural weeks and the like, encouraged their  retention. Since the students may spend their free time attending extracurricular  activities, this finding suggest that the university administration should  consider the importance of increasing different activities that interest the  students.<br>
    Maguire  et al (2008) argued that students who persist at a school despite relatively  low levels of satisfaction are not only at risk of becoming less than  supportive alumni, but may also actually be proactive in spreading their  negative opinions of the institution. Should they do so via the Internet with  all its potential for viral amplification, the damage to the schools&rsquo;  reputation and future recruitment efforts could be substantial. To forestall  such an outcome, the school would do well to continually monitor student  satisfaction levels and take steps that improve those levels, especially on behalf  of students in this category.</p>
  <h1>Conclusions </h1>
  <p>On the basis of  the findings of the study, the following conclusions were drawn:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Downtrend  of enrolment at LCUP is very evident and must be considered crucial to program  viability and school operations.</li>
    <li>The anticipated  factors affecting attrition and retention rates at LCUP if not given enough  attention could have a major effect in the enrolment statistics of the  university</li>
    <li>Hopes  for higher retention rates are reliant on the concerted efforts between  academic and administrative units, as well as on individual faculty members and  academic support group.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Recommendations</h1>
  <p>Certainly,  there must be more than one way to help students stay in school. Specific ways  of helping the students in school are the following:<br>
    •        Make sure students have goals they are  working toward. Upon school admission, they should expect that they will  graduate and get employed after acquiring necessary life skills from the  school. They should have career goals and they need to see staying in school  and graduating as essential to their future.<br>
    •        Make sure that school is a positive  experience for students. It should not be all negative, with failures or  redirection. Monitor students closely, and, if they are struggling with  behavior or academics, intervene early. Make sure that there is frequent  communication between the parents and the school to ensure that students  receive extra support. Also, make sure that they are set up for positive  experiences and that those positives are highlighted.<br>
    •        Focus on early intervention. If a  student starts to struggle, make sure that they get support right away, because  early intervention is crucial to successful intervention.<br>
    •        Help the students to graduate on time.  This requires avoiding holding them back. There are times when a student should  fail. For example, in high school, they will have to retake a specific course  if they fail it. However, retaining students for immaturity or for not having  the skills at a young age should be avoided. Research shows that, after just a  few years, the students who were held back are no further ahead than similar  students who were promoted. There are too many alternatives, like extra  classroom support and individual tutoring to justify holding someone back.</p>
