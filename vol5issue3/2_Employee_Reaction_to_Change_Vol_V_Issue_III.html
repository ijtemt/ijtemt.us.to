Paper Title :<br>EMPLOYEE REACTION TO CHANGE<br>
A CASE OF THE DIRECTORATE OF PUBLIC WORKS IN ALBANIA
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Present trends in change and change management in Albania reflect a sense of urgency on the part of governments to invigorate a public sector that is able to maintain continuity and change. However, this means that public sector employees, who play a key role in the implementation of change, are now called upon to adjust their thinking and practices to respond to the changing needs and expectations demanded of them by governments.  The paper is the theoretical and empirical study of the concept of change and change management and its connection with issues of resistance to change on behalf of the employees. The results of a statistical study conducted using questionnaire, answered by 115 employees of Central Directorate of Public Works in Albania, showed quite low openness to change and low degree of recognizing motives of resistance to change.

  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction </h1>
  <p>Present  trends in change and change management in Albania reflect a sense of urgency on  the part of governments to invigorate a Public Service that is able to maintain  continuity and change. However, this means that public sector employees, who  play a key role in the implementation of change, are now called upon to adjust  their thinking and practices to respond to the changing needs and expectations  demanded of them by governments.&nbsp; In an  organization, resistance is opposition or withholding of support for specific plans  or ideas. It can be intentional or unintentional, covert or overt. The issue of  resistance on the part of employees is also discussed because resistance and  change are intertwined. It must be stressed out that resistance to change is a  major concern of management overall in public or private organization of  today.&nbsp; In addition, because the &lsquo;process  of change is present, employee resistance has been seen as a critical  contributor to the failure of many well-planned efforts to initiate change  within the organization.</p>
  <h1>Organizational  Change, Change Management and Resistance to Change</h1>
  <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
  <p>A  nation&rsquo;s well-being depends a great deal on the quality and performance of its  education, government and business sectors. Before the 1980s, most public  organizations worked in an environment illustrated as protected against a  backdrop of relative security, stability and predictability. Thus, most public  and private sector organizations saw no particular reason to contribute to a  particular goal of change. On the other hand, it is preserved that many public  sector organizations, were judged to be inefficient and ineffective. In order  for these organizations to be effective and to improve performance, it became  important for both employers and employees to have a shared perception of  change. Additionally, it became necessary for both parties to commit to change  when it was required.<br>
    What is  change? One of the many definition of change is the involvement of the  &ldquo;crystallization of new possibilities (new policies, new behaviors, new  patterns, new methodologies, new products or new market ideas) based on the  reconceptualised patterns in the institution. The architecture of change  involves the design and construction of new patterns, or the  reconceptualisation of old ones, to make new, and hopefully more productive  actions possible&rdquo;. <br>
    Lending  support to the above view, it is also important that employees be given key  opportunities to participate in change initiatives. Employees should always be  the key players in the facilitation, implementation and management of effective  change since employees in some form or the other, are directly involved in the  process of change. It is just as important, to recognize that employees can  also be the main obstacle to implementing change. </p>
  <h2>Reasons  for Change</h2>
  <p>Why  change? It is argued that many of the present approaches to organizational  change are from a world view that is no longer compliant with the early  twenty-first century. Currently, most organizations because of globalization  and modern technology are faced with uncertainties. In addition, some factors  responsible for the changes are described: new technologies, globalization, new  change processes and practices, speed, and complexity and paradox which are  increasing as a result of all these changes and are making more and more  difficult demands. Based on the factors outlined above, it must be noted that  change can occur as a result of either external or internal forces or a  combination of both. <br>
    External  forces may still be influenced by political factors in the past and present at  the current time. For example, the government in power might adopt new policies  that will impact upon the types of change chosen. Economic environment also has  a key influence on the type and nature of change; social factors as well as  technological forces also play an influential role regarding change. In  addition, to highlight the importance of internal factors in the change  process, Thus, organizations need to consider the reasons for wanting change  and when to implement change taking into consideration the models or approaches  that will ensure successful change in that particular public sector  organization.</p>
  <h2>Models  of change management </h2>
  <p>Many  change models and theories exist in the literature for implementing change in  public sector and private sector organizations. Coupled with models of change  is the issue of approaches to change. In this discussion, four models of change  that demonstrate the fundamental approaches that aid an understanding of the  nature of change processes and the basis for successful change implementation  is presented. Models of change, as opposed to strategies of change, are best  presented as basic frameworks that guide the strategies for change to be  implemented in the organization. <br>
    The use  of the term &ldquo;model&rdquo; refers to a set of assumptions and beliefs which together  represent reality. Stemming from this definition, two key traditional models of  change are discussed. Lewin&rsquo;s planned approach to organizational change work  resulted in a model that views change as a three-step procedure: unfreezing,  moving (initiate the change), refreezing. Kotter&rsquo;s model of change involves  eight steps in the change process: increasing urgency, build the guiding team,  developing a vision, communicating the change vision, empower action, create  short term wins, generate short-term wins, make change stick. </p>
  <h2>The  nature and causes of resistance to change</h2>
  <p>Often  change is done to adapt to the changing environment condition in local  government. Resistance to change by employees is a common phenomenon, which  takes place in both private and public sector organizations. Employees often  respond negatively toward change, because with change comes stress and  uncertainty for employees. The reasons for the failure range from a lack of  understanding surrounding an organization&rsquo;s capacity for change to other  factors, for instance employee resistance toward change. Resistance to change  is seen as the most common problem faced by management in implementing change.  In addition to that change is a resistance itself is a defense mechanism to  maintain the status quo or when employees status quo is threaten. It is  suggested that even though change effort could be to the benefit of the  employees, some employees are predisposed to resist change. Resistance is  described as a multifaceted phenomenon due to costs, unexpected delays, and  instabilities into the process of change. In addition, resistance is seen as a  slow motion reply to meet agreement or disagreement to change.<br>
    Resistance  to change in employee behavior falls into two categories: active and passive  resistance. Active resistance is seen when employees engage in behaviors  related with manipulation, fault-finding and fear. While on the other hand,  passive resistance is linked with ignorance, withdrawal of information and lack  of action following verbal compliance. <br>
    Many  writers, in the literature on resistance to change, have concluded that  employees resist change because they are afraid to lose something that is of  value to them. In addition to that, they do not believe that the change will  make sense in the organization, they do not understand the change and its  implications, or they find it difficult to manage the level or practice of  change. Here are six common causes that grow employee resistance to change. <br>
    Resistance  is present when the nature of the change is not made understandable to the  employees who are directly influenced by the change; employees influenced feel  strong forces discourage them from changing; the change is made on personal  grounds: employees influenced by the change have pressure put on them to act in  accordance with instead of having an input in the nature of the change; the  change pays no attention to the already established institutions in the group,  and the change is open to many interpretations. In addition, resistance to  change can be linked with the leadership styles, employees being skeptical to  the value of change, the uncertainty of change, the internal dynamics of the  organization; and an unfavorable work environment. </p>
  <h2>Resistance to change in public sector</h2>
  <p>Within  the context of public sector organizations, the following reasons why public  service employees resist change are identified: dedication to bureaucratic  practices related to legalism, procedural regulation, delegation; the need for  caution and security; complexity due to multiple levels of authority,  responsibility and reporting; decision-making pushed upwards; affairs are lead  by the interests of many stakeholders; conflicting values, interests, alliances  agendas, reward structures; difficult to gain financial support for change  management. <br>
    Some  literature suggests that public sector organization continue to in a structured  fashion, increasing resistance to change. In addition, managers in public  sector overstate the outcomes  of the changes they have initiated resulting in greater resistance to change by  employees. It should be mentioned that not all public sector employees resisted  change. Some common forms of resistance displayed employees that are most prone  to resist change are employees with limited educational qualifications, who  fear that they are too old to learn, doubt their value to the organization and  are influenced by older employees to resist change, who&rsquo;s status quo is challenged  . Based on these authors, here are some common forms of resistance displayed  through the behaviors of public sector employees: embarrassing leaks to press  and media, lateness, indifference, sabotage, absence, sick leave,  procrastination, working slowly, undermining behind-the-back criticism. <br>
    In  essence, change management requires employees to reorganize the way in which  they undertake their roles within a public department. In order to manage  change effectively in public sector organizations, change initiators should  first stand back and analyze the organization before applying any sort of  change. It is also maintained that for public sector employees to understand  and accept organizational change, they need to engage in its process. To sum  up, resistance to change is one of the most frequent employees&rsquo; reactions to  change.&nbsp; In addition, it is viewed as a  normal and inevitable course of action because of fear of the unknown and  uncertainty. Resistance to change has been recognized as an important factor that  impacts the success of a public organizational change effort. Thus, it is  critical to identify the main causes of employees&rsquo; resistance to change,  highlighting the benefits of change.</p>
  <h1>METHODOLOGY</h1>
  <p>The  population on whom the research was based is the employees of Central  Directorate of Public Works in Albania. This research was a descriptive one and  with the use of quantitative data to measure employee reaction towards change. For  the purpose of this research, 180 questionnaires were distributed and the study  sample was amounted to 120 employees. A number of research questions helped  analyze the issues of this study, based on literature review and on this thesis  aims and objectives: What is the degree of openness of the employees to change?  What are the main motives of employee resistance to change? What are the main  reasons of employee resistance to change? &nbsp;What is the impact of employee demographic  characteristics toward their reactions to change? <br>
    Based on  the above, the corresponding research hypotheses of the research are:<br>
    H1 - There is a negative relationship  between &ldquo;openness to change&rdquo; and &ldquo;motives of resistance to change&rdquo; factors.<br>
    H2 - There is a negative relationship  between &ldquo;openness to change&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasons for resistance to change&rdquo; factors.<br>
    H3 - There is a positive and relationship between &ldquo;reasons for  resistance to change&rdquo; and &ldquo;motives of resistance to change&rdquo; factors.<br>
    The  statistical research was conducted based on a Likert - scale questionnaire  which was created for the research and distributed to employees via email and  in person. It was divided into three categories: Openness to change, Motives of  resistance to change, Reasons for resistance to change. People were asked to  rate their agreement with a series of involvement statements on a seven point  scale where 1 _ strongly disagree and 7 _ strongly agree.<br>
    To test  the internal consistency and reliability of the responses a-Cronbach's  coefficient was calculated. By testing the reliability coefficients of Cronbach  for the individual factors of the questionnaire but also for the whole research  tool, it was found that it is satisfactory in each case. A pilot test was done  responses of the research were processed and the results were: Openness to  change were (Cronbach&rsquo;s &#945;= .0.903 respectively). Motives of resistance to  change (Cronbach&rsquo;s &#945;= 0.705 respectively). Reasons for resistance to  change were (Cronbach&rsquo;s &#945;= .0.805 respectively). </p>
  <h1>RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION</h1>
  <p>According  to research results, it was at original documented that employee openness to  change is quite high, though the most major motives of resistance to change are  feeling of insecurity for loss of their position in the organization and&nbsp; sense of testing their status quo. It is  important for managers to communicate with their employees about the needs for  change, otherwise fear and uncertainty will remain an existing element that can  damage morale and prevent successful implementation of organizational change. However,  it is normal for an employee during change to resist since resistance itself is  a defense mechanism to preserve their status quo. <br>
    In  addition, the difficulty of managing change is often exacerbated by the  mismanagement of employee resistance. On the other hand, employees with the  moderate degree of resistance to change feel that they have the necessary  information to being open to organizational changes and they understand the  change objectives. Early communication can decrease uncertainty, neutralize  rumors before spreading all through the organization. Employees should be  informed on how the change will influence their jobs, when the change will take  place, what is expected of them, how the change will be implemented, and how  the company will support and motivate them to be more committed to the change.</p>

  <p>Regarding  research&rsquo;s hypotheses, it is observed that H1 &amp; H2 are not accepted, as the  correlation between &ldquo;openness to change&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasons and motives of resistance  to change&rdquo; factors is negative but not statistically significant. Hence, the  research&rsquo;s results show that the level of openness to change is not determined  by Reasons and Motives for resistance to change. The explanation behind this  is&nbsp; due to the fact that in this  research, while employees showed a quite satisfactory degree of &ldquo;openness to  change&rdquo; factor, the degrees of Motivesof resistance to change&rdquo; and &ldquo;Reasons for resistance to change&rdquo;  factors were low. As many writers argued, even though the main reason why  employees resist change is their personal interest, but most of them usually  understand the need for change and believe that it will make sense for the  organization. H3 of this research is also accepted as the correlation between  &ldquo;reasons for resistance to change&rdquo; and &ldquo;motives of resistance to change&rdquo;  factors is positive and statistically significant, proving an close  relationship between this two factors regarding employees reactions towards  organizational change. Thus, with a logical approach, higher motives of  employees lead to higher reasons for resistance to change. <br>
    Finally,  it was observed that none demographic factor influences employees&rsquo; resistance  to change, except from education level as less educated employees showed  stronger motives of resistance to change. Thus, change management should focus  on less educated employees in order to alleviate negative attitudes towards  organizational change, providing more training. To sum up, employees are quite  open and adaptive to public organizational change in the Central Directorate of  Public Works in Albania, though specific motives and reasons behind resistance  to change require explicit attention, including clear planning, communication,  empowerment, training, and involvement. </p>

  <h1>Limitations </h1>
  <p>As in any research, this one also has some  limitations. Further research should be conducted in a larger sample in order  to generalize the results. In addition more parameters of the sample can be  examined such as salary and job position in order to generalize or extract more  specific results and conclusions. </p>
