Paper Title :<br> INCIDENCE OF CHILD LABOUR:<br>
A CASE STUDY OF NANDA DEVI FAIR IN NAINITAL
</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This study examines the incidence of child labor at Nanda Devi fair, in Nainital, with respect to their socio-economic factors. With incidence of child labor, the family characteristics of working children were also investigated. Some of the questions pertaining to the loss of childhood of these working children have been raised. The association between these factors and learning outcomes is also examined within the stipulated constraints. The study can be used for making some effective policies, related to their educational and social development to fill the gap between reality and hope for removing the menace of Child Labor. One of the key objectives of the study was to understand and analyze various factors that cause children to get involved in work at a tender age. A wide range of factors may actually be involved in making a child work and often it is the combined effect of these factors. However, some of these factors are believed to have a direct link with the incidence of child labor. This study made an attempt to understand the causal relationship between the literacy and income of the household with the involvement of children in work. Moreover, the study throws light, on future prospects of working children and gives some suggestions to save the precious childhood.

  <h1>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p>&ldquo;Bestow  blessings on those Little, innocent lives Bloomed on Earth, Who have brought  the message of joy from heavenly garden&rdquo;. <br>
    -Rabindranath Tagore<br>
    &nbsp;Children are the greatest gift to humanity and  Childhood is an important and impressionable stage of human development as it  holds the potential to the future development of any society. Children who are  brought up in an environment, which is conducive to their intellectual,  physical and social health, grow up to be responsible and productive members of  society. Every nation links its future with the present status of its children.  By performing work when they are too young for the task, children unduly reduce  their present welfare or their future income earning capabilities, either by  shrinking their future external choice sets or by reducing their own future  individual productive capabilities.</p>
  <p>Under  extreme economic distress, children are forced to forego educational  opportunities and take up manual jobs which are mostly exploitative as they are  usually underpaid and engaged in hazardous conditions. Parents decide to send  their child for engaging in a job as a desperate measure due to poor economic  conditions. It is, therefore, no wonder that the poor households predominantly  send their children to work in early ages of their life. One of the  disconcerting aspects of child labor is that children are sent to work at the  expense of education. There is a strong effect of child negatively associated  with his or her capacity to attend school. Child labor restricts the right of  children to access and benefit from education and denies the fundamental  opportunity to attend school. Child labor, thus, prejudices affects their health  and safety.<br>
    In  recent times there has been a renewed attack on child labor citing grounds of  physical, moral and psychological trauma for the children and loss of  childhood. Such arguments have been stimulated by recent debates on human  rights, human capital formation and international labor standards. It is argued  that child labor exists in developing countries because there are both demand  for and supply of it. Faced with poverty, inequality social norms,  credit-land-labor market imperfections, high fertility and unpredictable  employment scenario children are sent to work in most cases by their parents.<br>
    The  supplementary income of children raises their nutritional standards, enables  their siblings to continue education and enhance their skill and future  prospect of employment. On the other hand producers demand child labor because  of substantially lower wages paid to children. Therefore child labor exists.  The incidence of child labor is accepted either as an undesired reality or as  an unavoidable necessity.</p>
  <h1>Background  of Study</h1>
  <p>In  India, the problem of child labor is well recognized. There are varying  estimates of the number of working children in the country due to differing  concepts and methods of estimation. Children are engaged in various types of work,  including those that are classified as 'hazardous', i.e. harmful to the  physical, emotional, or moral well-being of children. An estimated 2 million  children work in hazardous industries. Although there are inter-state and  inter-regional variations in India, the factors that generate child labor, and  hazardous child labor in particular, include parental poverty and illiteracy;  social and economic circumstances; lack of awareness; lack of access to basic  and meaningful quality education and skills; high rates of adult unemployment  and underemployment, and cultural values of the family and society.<br>
    The  problem of child labour continues to pose a challenge before the nation.&nbsp; Government has been taking various pro-active  measures to tackle this problem. However, considering the magnitude and extent  of the problem and that it is essentially a socio-economic problem inextricably  linked to poverty and illiteracy, it requires concerted efforts from all  sections of the society to make a dent in the problem.<br>
    According  to the Census 2001 figures there are 1.26 crore working children in the age  group of 5-14 as compared to the total child population of 25.2 crore. There  are approximately 12 lakhs children working in the hazardous  occupations/processes which are covered under the Child Labour (Prohibition  &amp; Regulation) Act i.e. 18 occupations and 65 processes. As per survey  conducted by National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) in 2004-05, the number  of working children is estimated at 90.75 lakh. As per Census 2011, the number  of working children in the age group of 5-14 years has further reduced to 43.53  lakh. It shows that the efforts of the Government have borne the desired  fruits. Poverty emerges to be necessary condition thereby preparing the  breeding ground but not sufficient to drive the children to the labor market.  Lack of Educational infrastructure is found to be very important in this  respect. This includes not only the physical but also the human component,  which is emerging to be more crucial. Poverty alleviation programmes must  therefore be complemented by expansion of educational infrastructure for  eradicating child labor.</p>
  <h2>Study  Area: Nainital and Nanda Fair</h2>
  <p>Nainital  is a popular hill tation in the Indian state of Uttarakhand situated at an  altitude of 2,084 metres (6,837 ft) above sea level in the Kumaun foothills of  the outer Himalayas. Nainital&rsquo;s unending expense of scenic beauty is nothing  short of a romance with awe-inspiring and pristine mother nature which attracts  tourists almost all of the year.<br>
    The  Nandadevi fair has its religious value &amp; it is held at Almora, Nainital,  Kot (Dangoli), Ranikhet, Bhowali, Kichha and also in the far flung villages of  lohar (like Milam and Martoli) and Pindar valleys (like Wachham and Khati). In  Nainital and Almora thousands take part in the procession carrying the dola (or  litter) of Nanda Devi. It is said that the Nanda Devi fairs started in Kumaon  during the reign of Kalyan Chand in the 16th Century. A three day fair is held  at Kot ki mai or Kot bhramari devi. The fair is rich in folk expressions and  many village products are brought for sale. The fair attracts tourists as well  as pilgrimage and most importantly the bread winners who come to the fair to  seek temporarily employment. Economic significance of the fair is most  important as being religiously important fair for hindus, this fair  extraordinarily involves people belong to every sect and religion.  Despondently, there was a high incidence of child labour in the fair, which  engrossed this research study.</p>
  <h2>Objective  of the Study</h2>
  <p>The main  objectives of the study were to:<br>
    &bull;  Examine the incidence and socio economic background of child labor involved in  economic activities in Nanda fair.<br>
    &bull;  Examine the family characteristics of children as depicted by them;<br>
    &bull;  Examine the reasons behind compelling them to work in this innocent age;<br>
    &bull;  Analyze their earnings and savings by them;<br>
    &bull;  Examining their educational pursuits.<br>
    &bull;  Present an overview regarding their future prospects and loss of their  childhood which is a matter of concern in the present scenario.</p>
  <h2>Methodology </h2>
  <p>The  study is based on primary data as survey was conducted in 3 days of Nanda fair,  in Nainital. There were 60 respondents sample which was selected as Convenience  Sampling Method selected purposively and non-randomly. All working children of  age 5-14 in the fair has been taken as Universe (Population). The size of the  sample was taken 60 (sixty) for the convenience and availability of short time  period. <br>
    Interview  schedules were administered as tools for the study. In study, &lsquo;Observation&rsquo; is  also used as a tool to cross-check the information told by the informants.  Microsoft Excel was used for the analysis of data.<br>
    To  understand child labour this definition is universally accepted. &ldquo;Child labor  is defined as the children in the age group of 5-14 years who are either  self-employed or are wage workers. Here usual principal status is considered</p>
  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  <p>Compelling  circumstances and family mores and tradition cause child labor of varying  character and intensity. A high prevalence of child labor is linked to poverty  and to poor quality or availability of education. Children in poor families  work because the family needs the extra income. It is assumed that most of the  child labour is from Nainital district and/or state of Uttrakhand.</p>
  <h1>Salient  Characterstics of Child Labour in Nanda Fair</h1>
  <p>Interviewing  to the working children, encapsulated the socio economic background of the  children. The interview schedule formed an important component of this study  because one can infer the socio economic condition and the aspects which  actually compelled a child to work. The educational decisions are governed by  the domestic circumstances whether to send a child to school or not, and  whether and when to withdraw a child from school. In India, especially in the  poor sections of the community, child labor cannot be taken in isolation. It  has to be seen in the wider social context. Thus both home and child factors  are important for determining the educational status and attainment of the child.</p>
  <h2>Working  Children inward movement to Nanda Fair</h2>
  <p>Findings  of the observation showed the high incidence of child labor in the fair. Mostly  the illiterate, semi-skilled and manual child workers have been coming in  search of better short term employment opportunities to Nainital to earn in  Nanda fair. Figure 1 shows that the areas from where they came are nearby  vicinities of Nainital, the highest percentage is from Ramnagar and Moradabad  the areas of State of Uttar Pradesh. The findings nulls the hypothesis that the  child labour in the fair belongs to Uttrakhand State are far above the ground.<br>

  <p>Table 1  shows that in Uttrakhand there are lesser child labour than Uttar Pradesh But  still the figure has some value and actions should be taken appropriately.</p>
  <h2>Type  of Family </h2>
  <p>In  Figure 2, the pie diagram, blue area shows the households having joint family  and red area shows households having nuclear family. There were very few  orphans. And it is obvious from the pie chart that households having joint  family are less in numbers than households having nuclear families. It is  important to notice that the size of the family with insufficient income may  compel a child to work for earning his/her own living to fulfill various needs.  A larger family size implies higher dependency ratio, making it difficult to  afford the education of all the children and pay due attention to them.<br>

  <h2>Religious  Composition </h2>
  <p>Religion  put measurable effect on society beliefs and their living style. Field survey  reveals that there are more Muslims working in Nanda Devi fair while Hindus are  relatively less and there are negligible Sikhs and Christians. It is clearly  shown in figure 3 where x axis represents the no. of child workers and y axis  represents different religions. The finding shows muslim community  participation in Hindu festival, which is really a good sign for cordial  relations among the different religions in Nainital.<br>

  <h2>Work  Summary of Child Labour</h2>
  <p>It is  very sad that in which age they deserve to be cared loved and  social-educational development, they are working for their survival. It is a  shame for the society that child labor persists. The survey in the fair shows  that the average age of child when he starts working is 10.19 which is really  very low and a matter of concern.<br>

  <h1>Constitutional  Provisions for Child Labour </h1>
  <p>Our  Constitution makers were wise and sagacious to provide, that children should  receive distributive justice in free India. The rights against exploitation  were mentioned in the draft proposed by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, K.M. Munshi and K.T.  Shah. Constitution of India contains provisions for survival, development and  protection of children; these are mainly included in Part III and Part IV of  the Constitution, i.e., fundamental rights and directive principles of state  policy. India follows pro-active policy towards tackling child labor problem. <br>
    The  concern for children in general and child labor in particular is reflected  through the Articles of the Constitution of India. In Article 23, it prohibits  traffic in human being and beggar and other similar forms of forced labor.  Under Article 24 it has laid down that &ldquo;no child under the age of 14 years  shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other  hazardous employment&rdquo;. Article 39(e) and (f) requires the State and secure that  the tender age of children are not abused and to ensure that they are not  forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited in their age or  strength. Those children are given opportunities and facilities to develop in a  healthy manner and conditions of freedom and dignity and that childhood and  youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material  abandonment. Article 45 provides, for free and compulsory education for all  children until they complete the age of 14 years. Article 51A(k) makes it a  fundamental duty of the parent or Guardian to provide opportunities for  education to the child or ward between the age of 6 and 14 years. Art. 21-A  recognizes that the Right to Education as fundamental right and it mandates  that, the state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of  age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the state may, by law,  determine.</p>
  <h1>Legal  Regulation of Child Labor in India</h1>
  <p>The  Child has been the subject of special laws and legal provisions. Because of its  tender years, weak physique, and inadequately developed mind and understanding,  every child needs protection against moral and physical harm and exploitation  by others. In the formative years of its life, the child needs special care  service to realize its full potential for growth and development. There are  about 300 Central and State Statutes concerning children. These have been  enacted with an intention to protect and help children and achieve the goal of  child labor welfare enshrined in our National charter.1 Further these laws are  applicable to children in various spheres of life, which are regulatory,  protective and correctional in nature. Laws are seeking to protect and promote  the rights of child. Under the law, children are entitled to special care,  assistance and essential needs and they should be given the highest priority in  the allocation of resources.&nbsp; <br>
    Legislation  to control and regulate child labor in India has existed for several decades.  Legislations have sought to address two broad concerns; (1) Prescribing minimum  age limit for employment of children and regulation of working hours for  children; and (2) Ensuring the health and safety of the child laborers by  prohibiting the employment of children in hazardous work. Several statutory  provisions prohibiting child labor and protecting interests of children of  tender age working as a child labor have been enacted before and after  independence to fulfill the commitment to international community and to oblige  the mandate provided under Constitution to eradicate the evil of child labor. <br>
    There  are number of child labor legislations prohibiting the employment of children  below 14 years and 15 years in certain specified employments. However, contrary  to our international commitment and all proclamations in the country&rsquo;s  Constitution, and despite all the legislative measures, child labor is a harsh  reality. Due to lack of political will and in absence of realistic measures to  tackle the problem.</p>
  <h1>A  Gap in the Implementation </h1>
  <p>From the  above provisions, it is clear that the Government has taken cognizance of child  labor as a major social problem in India, and is taking a number of steps to  eradicate it. Although nothing can be predicted about the potential success of  this legislative intent, it must be admitted that the efforts are steps in the  right direction. Unfortunately the things are not doing up to the mark. The  response of the Government and judiciary with regard to Child Labor in India is  highly commendable.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>Based on  the survey data, following observations are noticeably revealed.<br>
    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High incidence of child labour is found in  Nanda Devi fair, in Nainital<br>
    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the Children belong to joint  family and belong to Muslim community, whvich actually opposite of the  assumption that the fair of Hindu deity can attract only Hindu workers.<br>
    3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, nearly 85 percent children  came from nearby areas of Nainital and falls under UP state, which nulls one  hypothesis that the fair in Uttrakhand region is attracting majorly child  worker belong to Uttrakhand state.<br>
    4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the children said that they don&rsquo;t  have pucca houses &amp; don&rsquo;t have toilet facilities and hygienic at home,  which make it obvious that their lifestyle prominently welcomes diseases.<br>
    5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The percentage of child labor in work  demand more than 8 hours is highest. Average stipulated hours of working came  to be 9.5 hours. This clearly indicates the need for specific interventions  that have not been brought under the notification process yet.<br>
    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the working children started  working in tender age of 9 or earlier. And more than 72 percent left schools  due to poor family income.<br>
    7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 50% of the children said that they  don&rsquo;t go to school because they could not afford education. This came out as a  more important reason than the lack of interest in schooling. Also, around 14%  clearly said that the child was required to work to supplement the family  income and hence, don&rsquo;t have time for school. <br>
    8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligible percentage of working children  (5-14 years) said that they had received any kind of training for developing  their skills. <br>
    9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly 60 percent of children are getting  victimized of bad social environment and prone to be indulging themselves in  bad habits.<br>
    10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child labor supplementing their families by  their income so unable to save for themselves due to inadequate earnings.<br>
    11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very few have idea of leaving work for study  till their family conditions improve, while most of them have no idea to be out  of this vicious circle of labouring.<br>
    By  seeing conclusions we can infer that the hypothesis made for the study stands  true as a high prevalence of child labor is linked to poverty and to poor  quality or availability of education. Children in poor families work because  the family needs the extra income. It is assumed that poor households with no  savings and assets and inability to borrow have no choice but to send their  children out to work. As parent&rsquo;s income rise they are able to send their  children to school rather than to work. The more revelations tell that, mostly  child workers are stuck in the vicious circle of work and having no clue to be  free from the menace.</p>
  <h1>Future  a Matter of Concern</h1>
  <p>Expressed  in a generalized sense, the above factors constitute building blocks of a  vicious circle of continuing educational underdevelopment and are sustained by  each other. To achieve a virtuous circle of development, a straightjacket  approach of achieving demand and supply equilibrium has neither worked in the  past, nor would work in the future. As the regions/social groups progress  towards universal participation, the strategies to meet the basic learning  needs of the marginalized groups of population require an approach which is  future-oriented rather than extension of the established practices meant for  some other groups of population.<br>
    &quot;Poverty  is not only a problem of low incomes; rather, it is multi-dimensional problem  that includes low access to opportunities for developing human capital and to  education&quot;. Slum children too face educational deprivation in terms of  accessibility and quality as well.</p>
  <h1>Recommendations </h1>
  <p>Even  though the Indian government has launched various programmes and projects to  meet the basic learning needs of all children, the reality is far short of  expectations. In India, the state governments are responsible for the  implementation of educational reforms in school education. The Indian states  have considerable autonomy to establish their own priorities between and within  the development sectors and allocate the financial and other resources  accordingly.<br>
    The  intervention strategy of the project consists of developing a comprehensive  child labor elimination model for India by integrating four components. These  are<br>
    1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strengthening public education as a  measure to prevent child labor; <br>
    2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing vocational skills training to  adolescents in the age group of 14-17 years. Obviously, the vocational training  programs that can help the children develop skill-sets for the future and help  many of them come out of low-pay, hazardous work have not reached out to the  children that need them the most. The &ldquo;proportion of children trained&rdquo; should  be selected as one of the key indicators to measure the performance of child  rehabilitation programs.<br>
    3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitoring the impact of child labor  elimination efforts by tracking each beneficiary on the one hand and developing  a child labor monitoring system on the other, to capture the shifts in child  labor across different sectors and providing income generating opportunities to  the families of child labor. <br>
    4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, it seeks to support various  initiatives aimed at ending child labor through social mobilization and  increasing awareness. This is combined with the building of capacities and  training of government agencies and civil society partners. Mobilization of key  actors at the state and district level:<br>
    5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review of the implementation framework and  the existing rationalization plans of the government department, as well as the  guidelines for the selection and capacity building of NGOs and social workers  working for child labor. </p>
