<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper attempts to find out the level of job satisfaction and its relationship with various factors in an emerging economy like India. The Survey methods were used in public and private sector firms to find out the taxonomy of job satisfaction. The important factors that are taken into consideration are incentives and hours of work, Management (Boss) & Colleagues, Availability of other better opportunities, Future prospect (promotion and job security), Difficulty of job (manually tiring, forceful overtime), Job content and interest and Prestige. AfterPost liberalization Indian economy has seen an exponential growth in GDP (approx. seven folds from 1991) and since then job market in India has been growing rapidly.  The importance of job satisfaction has been supported by surveys conducted on 500 employees from different sectors in India and classified according to age, gender and region. This paper studies seven summary variables measuring job satisfaction among workers from different sectors of Indian job market.The seven factors at the end have been used to find out the answer for “who has got the good jobs” and how can the employee job satisfaction improved in a rapidly growing economy like in India. Frequency distribution analysis shows that job satisfaction is strongly correlated with all the job quality measures.</p>

    <li>INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Locke  [3] stated job satisfaction as a pleasurable positive state resulting from one's  job and job experience. Individuals show pleasurable positive attitudes when  they are satisfied with their job. Drever [4] described job satisfaction ''as  an end state of feeling. Similarly, a job is an important part of life, job  satisfaction influences one's general life satisfaction as an effective  reaction, feeling of employees with job, supervision, co-workers, salary/pay  and his/her current and future career progress. The causes of employees'  satisfaction are restricted to implant factors alone but they sum the whole  gamut of men's needs and aspirations. Job satisfaction is a general attitude  which is the result of many specific attitudes. It is essential to make a  distinction of job satisfaction from job climate and job involvement. Job  satisfaction is an effective or evaluative state while the concept of climate  is a descriptive, cognitive, and non-evaluative construct .This classification  is further emphasized in the work of (James and Jones, 1974; Locke, 1976;) as  mentioned in [2] and [3] .<br>
    The extensive research that has been done on levels of  job satisfaction may have distinctive applications to academic faculty. This is  especially true when the separation between satisfaction and dissatisfaction is  viewed in relation to the intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of academic  employment. In his well known motivational model, Herzberg [1] makes some basic  distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The differentiations are  founded on needs related to prime human characteristics, the ability to achieve  and through that achievement to experience psychological growth. The dual  factors arise from alternate needs that spring from basic animal nature, a  drive to avoid pain from the environment and all the learned drives that are  built on those basic needs. For example, an extrinsic factor, the drive to earn  a good salary, is built upon the basic need of hunger. However, intrinsic  factors such as responsibility and the satisfaction with work itself arise from  the human ability to personally advance and grow. In the educational setting,  intrinsic factors involve a direct link between faculty and their day to day  routine, the actual performance of the job itself. &quot;Intrinsic to the job  are: the work itself, responsibility, and growth or achievement (Herzberg,  1987).&quot; Herzberg's extrinsic or dissatisfaction-avoidance factors include  organizational policy, status, pay, benefits, and overall work conditions.  These factors comprise the background of one's work, the environment setting.  Extrinsic factors less immediately affect the day to day job but are always in  the background.<br>
    The most important information to have regarding an employee in an  organization is a validated measure of his/her level of job satisfaction. Behavioural  and social science research suggests that job satisfaction and job performance  are positively correlated. A better understanding of job satisfaction and  factors associated with it helps managers guide employees' activities in a  desired direction. The morale of employees is a deciding factor in the  organization's efficiency. Thus, it is fruitful to say that managers,  supervisors, human resource specialists, employees, and citizens in general are  concerned with ways of improving job satisfaction [12]. The foundation of job  satisfaction or job motivation theory was introduced by Maslow. He (1943, 1954)  asserts that human motives emerge sequentially to satisfy a hierarchy of five needs:  physiological (food, clothing, shelter, sex), safety (physical protection), social  (opportunities to develop close associations whit other persons), and  achievement/esteem (prestige received from others), and self-actualization  (opportunities for self-fulfilment and accomplishment through personal growth).  Individual need satisfaction is influenced both by the importance attached to  various needs and the degree to which each individual perceive that different  aspects of his or her life should, and actually do, fulfil these needs. Porter  (1961) argues that within the work environment, individual develop attitudes  concerning their jobs based upon their perception of the presence or absence of  positively-valued job characteristics that address specific needs. Thus, a  person&rsquo;s job satisfaction is result when job-related exceptions and needs  remain unfulfilled. Herzberg, Mauser and Snyderman (1959) posited the view that  job satisfaction is not a one-dimensional concept, but rather that work-related  variables which contribute to job satisfaction are separate and distinct from  those factors which contribute to job dissatisfaction. By 1968 Herzberg had  advanced the dual factor theory, which held that to not have job satisfaction  does not imply dissatisfaction, but rather no satisfaction, whereas the absence  of job dissatisfaction does not imply satisfaction with the job, but only no  dissatisfaction. Looked at in terms of &lsquo;opposites&rsquo;, the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo; of job  satisfaction is no satisfaction rather than dissatisfaction and the &lsquo;opposite&rsquo;  of job dissatisfaction is no job dissatisfaction, rather than satisfaction  According to Herzberg (1959), intrinsic elements of the job are related to the  actual content of work, such as achievement, recognition, the work itself,  responsibilities, and advancement. These were referred to as &lsquo;motivational&rsquo;  factors and are significant elements in job satisfaction. By contrast, Herzberg  described extrinsic factors as elements associated with the work environment,  such as working conditions, salary, working conditions, supervision, company  policy, and interpersonal relationships. These were referred to as &lsquo;context&rsquo; or  &lsquo;hygiene&rsquo; factors which are related to job dissatisfaction. Herzberg concluded  that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not on the same continuum. As a  result, he argued that income), and that such decisions are influenced by  intrinsic motives, such as seeking opportunities for professional growth  through compatible work activities and colleagues. Manger and Eikeland (1990)  also examined factors that impact on academics&rsquo; intentions to leave the  university, and found that relations with colleagues were the largest predictor  of intention to leave. They also found that general job satisfaction was a  further strong predictor of intention to leave. In short, academics who found  their work less intrinsically satisfying than others, more commonly intended to  leave the educational institutes. Salary or economic resources as such did not  appear to influence intentions to stay or go. Such studies indicate that the  &lsquo;climate&rsquo; or &lsquo;culture&rsquo; of the environment in which academics work has a large  influence on their feelings of satisfaction with the job as a whole, and their  commitment to stay in the job rather than seeking to fulfil intrinsic needs  elsewhere. The motivation to investigate the degree of job satisfaction arises  from the fact thata better understanding of employee satisfaction is desirable  to achieve a higher level of motivation which is directly associated with  student achievement. Recently, the assessment of employees&rsquo; attitude such as  job satisfaction has become a common activity in organizations in which  management is concerned with the physical and psychological well being of  people. The relationship between the individual and the factors determining job  satisfaction has been extensively researched in developed countries. In 1992,  it was estimated that over 5,000 articles and dissertations have examined the  topic of job satisfaction (Cranny et al., 1992), and this is a continuing topic  for research. An early assumption can be made that interest in the subject illustrates  the significance that employee satisfaction seriously influences the total  operation of an organization. Staples et al. (1998) suggest that the reason for  this interest is that work takes up such a significant amount of a person&rsquo;s  life, and by increasing an individual&rsquo;s overall satisfaction with his or her  work life improves the overall well-being of the individual, the organization,  and the society where both the individual and the organization reside.One  of the biggest preludes to the study of job satisfaction was the Hawthorne  studies. These studies (1924-1933), primarily credited to Elton Mayo of the  Harvard Business School, sought to find the effects of various conditions (most  notably illumination) on workers&rsquo; productivity. These studies ultimately showed  that novel changes in work conditions temporarily increase productivity. It was  later found that this increase resulted, not from the new conditions, but from  the knowledge of being observed. This finding provided strong evidence that  people work for purposes other than pay, which paved the way for researchers to  investigate other factors in job satisfaction. <br>
    Hackman  &amp; Oldham [14] proposed the Job characteristics model, which is widely used  as a framework to study how particular job characteristics impact on job  outcomes, including job satisfaction. The model states that there are five core  job characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy,  and feedback) which impact three critical psychological states (experienced meaningfulness,  experienced responsibility for outcomes, and knowledge of the actual results),  in turn influencing work outcomes (job satisfaction, absenteeism, work  motivation, etc.). The five core job characteristics can be combined to form a  motivating potential score for a job, which can be used as an index of how  likely a job is to affect an employee's attitudes and behaviors. To test the  present hypothesis, René Ziegler, Britta Hagen, and Michael Diehl, University  of Tübingen, Germany conducted a study in which job satisfaction, job  ambivalence, and job performance were measured cross-sectionally. Further, we  employed a scale to measure job satisfaction that is of a similar broad scope  as job performance. More specifically, both in social psychological attitude  research and in job attitude research it has been argued that it is important  for measures of attitude and behavior to be compatible in terms of their level  of generality (Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1977; Fisher, 1980; Judge et al., 2001; Harrison,  Newman, &amp; Roth, 2006).That is, it has been suggested and shown that the  attitude behavior consistency is higher when both attitudes and behavior are  measured at the same level of abstraction. Given that overall job performance  represents a global behavior assessment, we chose to measure job attitudes with  a measure of similarly broad scope. Accordingly, the Overall Job Satisfaction  Scale (Brayfield &amp; Rothe, 1951) was employed to measure job satisfaction  rather than a scale assessing an individual&rsquo;s satisfaction with various job  facets (e.g. JDI, Smith, Kendall, &amp; Hulin, 1969; MSQ, Weiss et al., 1967).<br>
    GeetaKumari  and Dr.K.M.Pandey [15] worked on analysis of an individual, sbehavior in work  environment for better output; this research explores the cause variables which  affect employee involvement. According to the empirical research finding,  high-intensity internal marketing generates positive impact upon employee  involvement and low-intensity internal marketing results in negative impact  upon employee involvement; the effect of sentimental relationship upon employee  involvement is prominent and positive; employees with personality traits of  internal control reveal higher level of involvement than those with external  control. Mainly this paper briefly narrates what has been studied so far on  lazy people. Geeta Kumari and  K.M.Pandey[16] worked on Job Satisfaction in Public Sector and Private Sector:  A Comparison. Their main findings are given below: Public Sector versus Private  Sector comparisons is a debate which seems to be a never ending topic. It is  very difficult to take stand for either of these two forms of administration.  The reason behind that is not unknown but obvious as both provide scopes in  different ways. Job satisfaction describes how content an individual is with  his or her job. The happier people are within their job, the more satisfied  they are said to be. This paper surveys both the sectors in most of the aspects  of analysis.. As the current findings show, jobholders vary regarding the  extent of ambivalence experienced with respect to their attitude toward their  job. The current findings also open up opportunities for further research  regarding the consequences of job ambivalence. For instance, the present  findings imply that job performance of individuals with high versus low job  ambivalence may fluctuate such that job performance is comparatively high when  positive beliefs and affective experiences are salient and thus predominate at  a certain point in time but that their performance may be comparatively low at  other times when negative beliefs and affective experiences are salient and  predominate. In this respect, research could, for instance, collect manager  perceptions of performance consistency. Future research should aim to replicate  the present findings with larger and more diverse samples as well as profit  from the use of multiple-item scales to measure job performance. Geeta Kumari  and K.M. Pandey [17] studied on stress management problem of Avtar steel  industries, Chennai, India. Their main findings are the followings. A sample  size of 100 is taken for the purpose of analysis made from primary and  secondary data. Out of the total sample most of the respondents are male and  many are between 50 and above.  Most of  the respondents are under graduate and have professional qualification.   Most of the respondents have 10-15 years of  long association with the organization.    Almost all the respondents are satisfied with the physical and  psychological working condition of the organization, and only fewer respondents  are dissatisfied with the psychological working condition of the  organization.   The opinion about the  training programs conducted by the organization is almost better, according to  majority of the respondents.<strong> </strong> <br>
    While  scales of the latter type focus specifically on cognitive processes, the set of  items of the OJS captures both affective processes and cognitive processes of  an individual&rsquo;s job attitude (see Footnote 1). With respect to job ambivalence,  similarly, we included items tapping both affective and cognitive processes to  obtain a broad measure of an individual&rsquo;s subjective experience of tension  regarding his or her job. According to a report by the  Associated Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry (Assocham), the Indian economy  will create 87.37 million new jobs by 2015. The report clearly shows that  Indian economy is rising and expected to grow by 7.5 per cent. The survey also  indicates that there is positive trend in terms of creating job market;  manufacturing sector reported maximum opportunities while agriculture  contributes minimal opportunities.The report clearly shows that India is rising  and becoming prosperous. Job satisfaction is a key consequence of attention in  the study of organizations.Unquestionably work plays central role in the life  of individuals. As employees spend half of the time in office it requires  mental satisfaction at work. Apart from the fact that it occupies a lot of  their time, it also provides the financial basis of their lifestyles. Thus, the context of employees&rsquo; job should be attractive and contribute  to their satisfaction. <br>
    This paper tries and answers few of these questions  with taxonomy of seven components of a good job. Job satisfaction has been  defined as a pleasurableEmotional state resulting from the appraisal of one&rsquo;s  job; an affective reaction to <strong>one&rsquo;s </strong>job; and an attitude towards one&rsquo;s  job. We can argue that job satisfaction is an attitude but researchers should  clearly distinguish the objects of cognitive evaluation which are affect  (emotion), beliefs and behaviours. This definition suggests that we form  attitudes towards our jobs by taking into account our feelings, our beliefs,  and our behaviours. Job satisfaction is not the sameas motivation, although it  is clearly linked.This report examines the distribution of &quot;good  jobs&quot; and &quot;bad jobs&quot;, defined and reported by workers  themselves. Survey of 500 workers across various sectors was done and the data  was analyzed to figure out the ways Indian industries can improve its employee  job satisfaction. The summary of taxonomy of good job as viewed by workers has  been presented:  Incentives and hours of  work, Management (Boss) &amp; Colleagues, Availability of other better  opportunities, Future prospect (promotion and job security), Difficulty of job  (manually tiring, forceful overtime), Job content and interest, Prestige. They  have been argued as an important correlates of a good job from workers point of  view. Some questioners ask yes or no questions while others ask to rate  satisfaction of 1-5scale (where 1 represents &quot;not at all satisfied&quot;  and 5represents &quot;extremely satisfied&quot;).</p>

    <li>TAXONOMY OF JOB  SATISFACTION.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To determine employee job satisfaction a  survey was conducted with a set a questions which asked them to rate job  satisfaction factors:  Incentives and  hours of work, Management (Boss) &amp; Colleagues, Availability of other better  opportunities, Future prospect (promotion and job security), Difficulty of job  (manually tiring, forceful overtime), Job content and interest, Prestige on the  scale of 1-5, 5 being most important factor and 1 being least. Then a question  was asked for which employees had to rate their own job satisfaction on the  scale of 1-5.<br>
    5- Highly satisfied, nothing can be  better<br>
    4- Fairly satisfied, things can be  improved with little efforts<br>
    3-Satisfied but not enough to hold you  at same position<br>
    2- Not satisfied and don&rsquo;t care if  situations improve<br>
    1-Highly frustrated, definitely need a  change in job.<br>
    These factors were chosen based on the  study of Clark, A. E. (1998), &ldquo;Measures of Job Satisfaction: What Makes a Good  Job? Evidence from OECD Countries&rdquo;, OECD Labour Market and Social Policy  Occasional Papers, No. 34, OECD Publishing. The attributes were found very  convincing and summarised the overall reasons of one being dissatisfied with  his/her job. Job satisfaction  is the feeling of self achievement aroused due to sense of comparison. Sense of  achievement generally comes when individual compare themselves with their  counterpart, say employees compare with the employees of other organization and  so on. Parity, in the sense, may make people (or employees) feel satisfied (or  job satisfied). Organization if wants their employees to be more satisfied with  their work then they have to update themselves with the information of other  organizations&rsquo; work ethics / culture and accordingly inculcate those in  theirs&rsquo;. Upheaval in work culture /ethics in recent decades made many  organizations lag behind others especially PSUs or government owned  organizations w.r.t their private counterparts who are more modernized or  updated as far as work culture /ethics, equipment, management committee and  other facilities (fiscal / non-fiscal given to employees) are considered. Many  aspects consist in work ethics / culture and each have significant importance  for employees&rsquo; satisfaction. Human resources management practices such as pay  practices, job training and supervision enhances job satisfaction of employees  and so turnover of company. Correlation among all these variables are well  highlighted and analyzed by Hamdia Mudor and  Phadett Tooksoon ,2011&rdquo;. Autonomy of  performing tasks, increased communication with co-workers in work place  reflects in higher job satisfaction and which is always a part of High  Performance Workplace Organization (Thomas K. Bauer, 2004). With the recent  change in work culture across the world and in general more influenced private  sector all over the world, Public sector undertakings have been seen lagging  behind as far as modern work ethics / culture is concerned. However, when PSUs  tried to compete with their private competitors, they focused on productivity  and so clients&rsquo; satisfaction but to achieve that they need to change or adapt  to the modern new work ethics and culture suddenly from feudal culture they had  been following for decades which in actual compelled many employees feel  uncomfortable to adapt to and so caused occupational stress and lesser  efficiency in their work.  Interrelation  among Job satisfaction, occupational climate and occupational stress is well  analyzed by K.K.Jain, Fauzia Jabeen, Vinita Mishra and Naveen Gupta in 2007.Job  satisfaction has been defined as a pleasurable emotional state resulting from  the appraisal of one&rsquo;s job; an affective reaction to one&rsquo;s job; and an attitude  towards one&rsquo;s job. We can argue that job satisfaction is an attitude but  researchers should clearly distinguish the objects of cognitive evaluation  which are affect (emotion), beliefs and behaviors. This definition suggests  that we form attitudes towards our jobs by taking into account our feelings,  our beliefs, and our behaviors. Job satisfaction is not the same as motivation,  although it is clearly linked. Job design aims to enhance job satisfaction and  performance; methods include job rotation, job enlargement and job enrichment.  Other influences on satisfaction include the management style and culture,  employee involvement, empowerment and autonomous work position. Job  satisfaction is a very important attribute which is frequently measured by  organizations. The most common way of measurement is the use of rating scales  where employees report their reactions to their jobs. Questions relate to rate  of pay, work responsibilities, variety of tasks, promotional opportunities, the  work itself and co-workers. Some questioners ask yes or no questions while  others ask to rate satisfaction on 1-5 scale (where 1 represents &quot;not at  all satisfied&quot; and 5 represents &quot;extremely satisfied&quot;). </p>

    <li>WHAT MAKES A GOOD  JOB?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are many theories giving necessary  attributes of a good job, some theories and analysis emphasise that a good job  is positively correlated with the incentives (Blanch flower, Oswald and Warr,  1993, for example) Employees based on gender, location and Sector were asked  asset of questions and the frequency distribution of the data has been plotted  and observed that it is more of less normal for few factors and skewed for  other towards right.</p>
  <p> <br>
    Figure 1.<br>
    Difficulty of job: no one considers it  to be highly important (5) factor and very few consider it to be moderately (3)  influencing factor for job satisfaction. Availability of other better  opportunity: Very high number of employees consider it moderately (3) important  factor for job satisfaction. And a very few rate it highly  important(4,5)Incentives and hours of work: very few considers it to be highly  important(5) factor and very few consider it to be moderately(3) influencing  factor for job satisfaction Management and colleagues: has been rated important  factor by high number of employees but rated highly important by only few. Job  prestige: has been rated important factor by high number of employees but rated  highly important by moderately huge group of employees. Future prospect: Rated  very highly important factor (5) by maximum number of employees and even rated  important (4) by high number of employees. Job content and interest: Rated very  highly important factor (5) by maximum number of employees and even rated  important (4) by high number of employees.<br>
    This data has been  assumed to be more of less normally distributed. Weight age factor (WF) for  each parameter has been calculated using average method. <br>
    <br>
    TABLE I.<br>
    WF can be used to tell how much a factor  affects the Overall job satisfaction of an employee. Higher the weight age  higher importance the factor has. Job content and interest is still a favoured choice  of most employees in their job. Difficulty of job has been least important in  determining job satisfaction. Incentives and hours of work has seems to be a  very important factor but WF shows that it is only fifth most important factor  in determining job satisfaction.</p>

    <li>JOB SATISFACTION IN  INDIA.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>India has been economically very  progressive in last few decades. Survey has been conducted across the nation,  North (Noida and Gurgaon), East (Kolkata), West (Ahmedabad), South (Chennai,  Bangalore) in various sectors. Each employee has been asked to rate his job  satisfaction on the scale of 1-5.<br>
    The data has been  plotted for Sector, gender and location.</p>

<p>More number of Females working in  Pharmaceutical companies in Northern India is satisfied with the job than in  any other region. Similarly for males, the trend has been bit similar except  that male employees in eastern pharmaceutical companies are as well satisfied. Study  reflects that pharmaceutical companies in north and eastern India has more  number of satisfied employees that south or western region of India.. (Fig 7,  8). Study shows that in manufacturing sector most of female employees are in  all the regions are not satisfied  with  their job where as males seem to be satisfied in this sector in South, north  and western region..(Fig9, 10). In Education sector females most of the region  has a good satisfaction level, none of the female is dissatisfied with the job.  Whereas 33% males are dissatisfied and rest are either satisfied or highly  satisfied with their job.. (Fig 11, 12).In IT overall job satisfaction is quite  good in most of the regions with males and females. Except for few males who  seem to be highly frustrated and rate their job satisfaction 1. (Fig 13, 14).  In commerce and financial sectors High number of females are dissatisfied in  western India whereas male are highly satisfied in southern India (Fig.15, 16).</p>

  <li>CONCLUSION.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning from values  to outcome 7 broad attributes of a good job were identified. It has been shown  that in India Employees tend to love their job if they get what they believe is  an important attribute of a good job. Weightage factor of each such attribute  based on exhaustive survey has been calculated. Region, sector and gender wise  study of job satisfaction has provided consistent picture with respect to  distribution of dataset analysed showed that most of the employees in Indian industry  are not satisfied with their job except for a few like male in commerce sector  and female in education sector. Total job satisfaction level of males is found  to be higher than that of woman. Total job satisfaction level in manufacturing  sector is found to be very low. In order of job satisfaction levels North has  been best followed by South, East and West Study has been done on a broad  level, which shows that overall job satisfaction level in India is very low.  Improvement in job satisfaction level can be can done on the identified  attributes and WF can be calculated for any organisation or a standard can be  used to improve working environment quality, so as to make employees feel good.  Job satisfaction depends on number of variables and can only be sorted at  ground level by individual human resource department of particular industry. </p>
