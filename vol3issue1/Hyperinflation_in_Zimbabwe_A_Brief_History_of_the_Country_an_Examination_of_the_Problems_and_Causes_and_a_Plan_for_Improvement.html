  <p><em>Abstract</em>— Zimbabwe is one of the  world&rsquo;s poorest nations with a per capita income of $500 and purchasing power  parity GDP of $6.9 billion in US dollars. Zimbabwe did away with its own form  of currency in 2009, the Zimbabwean dollar, as a result of out-of-control  inflation rates that virtually rendered the currency useless, the principal  focus of this paper. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s unemployment rate of 95%, according to 2009  estimates, is the highest in the world, as official employment in the country  is exceptionally limited. <br>

  <h1>About the Study</h1>
  <p>Zimbabwe,  a country deriving its name from indigenous archaeological structures dating  back to 800 AD entitled &ldquo;Great Zimbabwe,&rdquo; is an impoverished African nation  that gained its independence from the United Kingdom within the last five  decades. In the 1800s, Cecil John Rhodes and his large, successful company, the  British South Africa Company, met with the tribal chieftain of the area and had  him sign documents that claimed a friendship with Britain and allowed no more  than 10 white men to mine in the area. Included in this document, called the  &ldquo;Rupp Concession,&rdquo; were statements that contradicted what was previously  specified to the chieftain—specifically, no mention of a limitation of white  men allowed to mine—and a clause that expressly stated that operations could  continue as long as and whenever necessary (&ldquo;A Brief History of Zimbabwe&rdquo;). <br>
    With  Rhodes&rsquo; ownership of the area, and with the support of Britain, Rhodes  requested support from the British government in an attempt to control the area  that would later be named Rhodesia. Rhodesia was controlled under the auspices  of colonial policies of Britain, advanced by the threat of heavily-armed  British soldiers should a rebellion be attempted. Rhodesia adopted incredibly  racist policies that prevented African or black people from owning property,  voting in elections, or holding office, among other preventative and  prohibitive policies adopted by the Rhodesian government (&ldquo;A Brief History of  Zimbabwe&rdquo;). <br>
    Finally,  the people of Rhodesia decided they had enough of this—particularly the  policies of the minority whites of old who almost entirely controlled the  country. In 1965, the Unilateral Declaration of Independence, or UDI, was  signed by Prime Minister Ian Smith despite strong protests by the courts of  Britain and Rhodesia. No attempts were made to militarily reclaim the country,  but economic sanctions were imposed that lasted 14 years. Finally, in 1970, a  continuous war in support of independence broke out, led by the Zimbabwe  African National Union and the Zimbabwe African People&rsquo;s Union, in addition to  support lent by several independent African countries and the Soviet Union and  China. This war ended in 1979 when the United Kingdom conceded and granted  independence via a democratic constitution. Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, a  current household name, was selected as the first prime minister of the  independent country Zimbabwe in 1980 (&ldquo;A Brief History of Zimbabwe&rdquo;).<br>
    Zimbabwe  is one of the world&rsquo;s poorest nations with a per capita income of $500 and  purchasing power parity GDP of $6.9 billion in US dollars. Zimbabwe did away  with its own form of currency in 2009, the Zimbabwean dollar, as a result of  out-of-control inflation rates that virtually rendered the currency useless,  the principal focus of this paper. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s unemployment rate of 95%,  according to 2009 estimates, is the highest in the world, as official  employment in the country is exceptionally limited. The key industries in  Zimbabwe are mining, especially of coal and precious metals, steel, wood  products, cement, and chemicals, among others. Zimbabwe exports platinum,  cotton, tobacco, gold, ferroalloys, and textiles, primarily to other African  nations. Moreover, Zimbabwe is a net-importing country with a differential of  nearly $1.3 billion USD (&ldquo;Central Intelligence Agency&rdquo;). <br>
    The  Republic of Zimbabwe is a parliamentary democracy with a chief of state and  head of government. The current chief of state, President Robert Mugabe, was  the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe after its independence from the United  Kingdom was granted in 1980. In the current day, the prime minister is now the  head of government; this position is held by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai.  In addition to these governmental officials, there is a bicameral legislative  body with a Senate, the upper house, and a House of Assembly. Despite this  structured government, there is still significant political uncertainty in the  country (&ldquo;Central Intelligence Agency&rdquo;).<br>
    As  was mentioned earlier in this paper, a period of hyperinflation destroyed  Zimbabwe&rsquo;s currency and reduced the value—domestically and internationally—to  essentially nothing. Jayson Coomer and Thomas Gstraunthaler, in their article  in The Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, attribute the roots of this  hyperinflation to the nearly ten-year long war that was waged during Zimbabwe&rsquo;s  fight for independence. Fiscal mismanagement and excessive military  expenditures followed suit leading to an increasingly uncontrollable inflation  rate (Coomer 312). <br>
    Coomer  and Gstraunthaler define the beginning of the hyperinflation crisis between the  years of 1997 and 2000. When the Zimbabwean government launched reform programs  to assist the already-ailing economy, commercial farming was almost solely in  the hands of &ldquo;about 4,000 white commercial farmers; while the indigenous  population continued to engage in subsistence farming&rdquo; (Coomer 318). These  subsistence farmers included veterans that helped in securing Zimbabwe&rsquo;s  independence two decades prior, which led to the acting Zimbabwean government  to provide financial assistance to &ldquo;60,000 war veterans, each of whom were to  receive an immediate compensatory payment of ZW$50,000 (the equivalent of US$  3,000 at the time), alongside a monthly pension equivalent to US$ 125&rdquo; (Coomer  318). However, these payments totaled 3% of the same year&rsquo;s GDP, leading to an  immediate budgetary inflation of 55% compared to the year prior. <br>
    As  a result of this drastic inflationary growth in such a short duration of time,  the World Bank halted the Zimbabwean government&rsquo;s standing line of credit. To  make matters worse, the war veteran population that received the payment  package was still unsatisfied with the conditions they faced in their  day-to-day life and the selection of property that was available. The  government then decided that the only option was to commandeer a large portion  of the white-owned commercial farmland for sale to native non-white Zimbabweans  (Coomer 319). The government&rsquo;s takeover of these commercial farms was violent,  as reported by Celia Dugger of the New York Times, and conducted through  &ldquo;violent invasions by thousands of Mugabe supporters&rdquo; (Dugger). Perhaps more  concerning than the abrupt policies themselves was the fact that the government  of Zimbabwe failed to account for or refused to provide the financial data that  would occur as a result of these policies—both the payout/pension plan and the  land takeover program.<br>
    Dugger  expounds on one of the more significant problems that this land-grab program  caused, and that perhaps was an unforeseen effect in these violent takeovers.  Inhospitable business conditions for the white commercial farms were part of  the Mugabe regime&rsquo;s solution to the land deals that caused many to flee in  search of more promising prospects. This, in turn, caused many black workers to  be suddenly out of work and without an income. Consider this telling quote from  Dugger&rsquo;s article &ldquo;Zimbabwe: From Riches to Rags&rdquo; in the New York Times: <br>
    &ldquo;[The  land acquisition policies] not only sent white farmers and professionals  packing for other countries, it threw hundreds of thousands of black farm  workers out of work. As its farming sector collapsed, what had been one of the  breadbaskets of Africa could no longer even feed itself&rdquo; (Dugger).<br>
    Nevertheless,  and unsurprisingly, this started a massive &ldquo;flight of foreign capital&rdquo; from the  country and &ldquo;caused crashes in the Zimbabwean money and capital markets and  exhausted the foreign reserves of the RBZ [Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe]&rdquo; (Coomer  319). The &lsquo;Black Friday&rsquo; of Zimbabwe transpired when the Zimbabwean dollar fell  in value 75% against the United States dollar on November 14, 1997. Zimbabwe&rsquo;s  debilitated economy was damaged further when President Mugabe decided to send  an unbudgeted 11,000 troops to the DRC&rsquo;s Laurent Kabila to help quell a civil  war perpetrated not only by disenfranchised DRC residents but also by Uganda  and Rwanda.<br>
    The  Economist Intelligence Unit&rsquo;s (EIU) Views Wire publication provides the serious  consequences that occurred because of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s ubiquitous fiscal  mismanagement: the overall index of measured manufacturing production fell by  nearly 35% between 1999 and 2003. Perhaps more indicative of the dire situation  in Zimbabwe is the discrepancy between 1999 and 2003 in foodstuffs production:  a 42.9% decrease was the aftermath of a declining output and an increasingly  unemployed labor force. The output of two of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s largest export  industries fell harshly in that half-decade, as well: textiles by 63.3% and  tobacco (which at one point accounted for one-third Zimbabwe&rsquo;s export balance) and  drink by 35.6% (&ldquo;Zimbabwe: Historical Data - Manufacturing Production&rdquo;). <br>
    Exploring  the outcome of this declining economy with inflation figures—month-over-month  and year-over-year—from Zimbabwe as calculated by Steve Hanke, an applied  economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, and Alex Kwok, a research  associate at an institute at Johns Hopkins University, decisively tells us how  terrible the situation got. Between January 2007 and November 2008 is when  Zimbabwe&rsquo;s inflation rate truly began to head to the point of no return. The  year-over-year inflation rate rose significantly every month between the  January 2007 and November 2008 time frame except for one insignificant  reduction in August of 2007. The figures are staggering: starting in January 2007,  the year-over-year inflation rate was 2,200.2%; by January 2008, this figure  was up to 100,580.16%; by May 2008, the figure reached the millions:  2,233,713.43%; by August 2008, the percentage figure was in the billions; and  finally, by November 14th, 2008, the figure was  89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000.00% with the month-over-month inflation rate  being 79,600,000,000.00% itself (Hanke 3).<br>
    In  these conditions, the currency becomes worthless; the following quote is from a  Reuters article in January 2009: &ldquo;Hyper-inflation has forced the central bank  to continue to release new banknotes which quickly become almost worthless&rdquo;  (Banya). In order to combat the accurately-described constant devaluation of  the Zimbabwean dollar, the government was at one point forced to introduce a  100-trillion dollar banknote that was worth $33 on the black market. Reuters  again reports on the situation: &ldquo;Previous issues of new banknotes have done  little to curb the cash crunch faced by Zimbabweans, who often line up for  hours outside banks to withdraw barely enough to buy a loaf of bread&rdquo; (Banya). <br>
    Since  this period of turmoil in Zimbabwe, things are back on the road to recovery. In  2009, Mugabe&rsquo;s government lifted a long-time ban on foreign currency and  quickly the U.S. dollar became the informal currency of the country. The  Economist reports promising but still uncertain news on the inflation front in  Zimbabwe: <br>
    &ldquo;Now  the American banknotes the economy relies on have to be begged, borrowed or  earned. Even so, the monetary system works surprisingly well. A scarcity of  greenbacks keeps inflation in the low single digits. The economy has made up  much lost ground&rdquo; (&ldquo;Zimbabwe after Hyperinflation: In Dollars They Trust&rdquo;).<br>
    One  is also pleasantly surprised at the following figure from the same article:  &ldquo;Then came the hot money [USD] as violence after disputed elections in 2008  receded and the economy recovered. Bank deposits increased by 31% last year, to  $4.4 billion&rdquo; (&ldquo;Zimbabwe after Hyperinflation: In Dollars They Trust&rdquo;). Though  things are not for certain in Zimbabwe, they are headed in the right direction;  a direction that many would not have thought possible in late 2008. <br>
    Though  the economy is currently improving, there are several things the Zimbabwean  government should focus on to develop growth steadily and sustainably. First,  there are many positives that Zimbabwe should take advantage of: exploration  missions for precious metals, especially copper, gold, and platinum, as well as  diamonds, and the development of the infrastructure necessary to harvest these  desirable resources and transport them safely. Not only would this add to the  infrastructure of the country, but would also create at least short-term jobs  to assist in building this infrastructure and consequently lowering the unemployment  rate. Additionally, and without detracting from the industrial progress of the  country, agriculture should be focused on to get those that are unemployed back  into the labor force and working; trained farmers should take on management of  the underperforming or unused commercial farms, thus employing manual laborers  in the process and improving lives. <br>
    As  for the flipside of the coin, it is obvious that one of the pervasive negatives  of the country is the government in control. Though strides have been made to  include the opposition party in government decisions as evidenced by the  selection of the new prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, Mugabe&rsquo;s regime has  been accused of corruption and cover-up, scandal and poor decision making. An  overthrow of the government is not what is being suggested, particularly  because Mugabe is relatively old and should not retain power that far into the  future. In this case, new leadership can take over; hopefully leadership that  understands what needs to be done. Violence has subsided recently to an  extent.  Moreover, foreign direct  investment in the healthcare system could be beneficial for companies&rsquo;  profits—a healthy worker is much easier to invest in. Unfortunately, this  benefit won&rsquo;t be noticed right away.</p>
