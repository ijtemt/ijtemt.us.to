  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>For  any organization human resource is the only asset which can appreciate with  time if provided with proper inputs. The performance of an individual in an  organization is dependent on different direct and/or indirect variables. Direct  which has immediate impact on the performance of an individual whereas indirect  are those which affects the performance after following a systematic approach  which can enhance their work commitment and hence performance. Among all those  variables training and development activities taken by the human resource  department of any organization is one of them. Training is broadly defined as  an instructor lead content based intervention which is done to develop a  desired change in the behavior of an individual so that he/she can perform the  same task repeatedly with more efficiency and accuracy; it is short time  horizon approach. Whereas development is long time horizon approach, targeting  on overall grooming of an individual for improving his/her on the job and off  the job decision making ability and hence improved higher level of work as well  as personal life satisfaction. Considering the aspect of importance of human  resource in an organization this study is conducted on the employees of Birla  cement work, Rajasthan for identifying training and development practices  followed in the organization for its employees.  <br>
    Birla  Cement Works (BCW) was commissioned in February 1967, the first dry process plant  with two stage suspension pre-heating technology in the country. Chief Minister  of Rajasthan, Late Shri M.L.Sukhadia in the year 1962, laid the foundation  stone of Birla Cement and the plant started functioning in the year 1967. Its  initial capacity of 2 lakh tones was increased to 4 lakh tones in 1992. In a  major modernization drive, the two stages pre-heater was converted into 5-stage  per heater and a modern computerized system were installed.</p>
  <p>With  the new technologies and environment friendly atmosphere, manufacturing cement,  Birla Corporation Limited, installed a new plant in the year 1986 called as  &ldquo;Chittor Cement Works&rdquo;. CCW is equipped with state-of-the-art equipments like  five stage per heater, in-line clinker, Hot ESP etc. were commissioned in 1986.  A central computerized control system with X-Ray analyzer and the other  sophisticated quality control systems have been provided to ensure the best  quality control systems have been provided to ensure the best quality cement  production. Technological up-gradation being an on-going policy of the company,  this unit was also modernized and its production capacity increased from 5  lakhs per annum to 8 lakhs per annum, thereby raising the total production  capacity at Chittorgarh to 14 lakhs per annum <br>
    BCW  was the 1st cement plant in the country to install Electrostatic Precipitators  (ESP&rsquo;s) in order to control the dust emission. To further improve the  efficiency of ESP&rsquo;s, gas-conditioning towers have been installed and bag dust  collectors have also been provided at all material transfer point in both the  units. <br>
    Today  as many as 11 ESP&rsquo;s and 57 bag dust collectors are functioning efficiently to  control and maintain the emission levels well below the Air Pollution Control  Act. &ldquo;ENVIROCARE MICROMIST&rdquo; water spray system imported from USA has been  installed in both the kilns of B.C.W. and C.C.W. <br>
    It  is probably the 1st plant in the country to have such sophisticated equipment  and &ldquo;state-of-the-art technology&rdquo;. India&rsquo;s 1st &ldquo;HOT PULSE&rdquo; ESP was installed in  C.C.W. in view of the perennial water shortage in the area. Apart from these,  measures like water spraying tree plantation and covered storage are undertaken  to keep the atmosphere clean. Not only this, but also &ldquo;Dry Coal Benefaction  plant&rdquo; is also available.</p>
  <h1>Review of Literature</h1>
  <p>For  any organization Training &amp; Development can be defined as &ldquo;It is any  attempt to improve current or future employee performance by increasing an  employees&rsquo; ability to perform through learning, usually by changing the  employees&rsquo; attitude or increasing his or her skills and knowledge.<br>
    According  to Edwin B. Flippo, &ldquo;Training is the act of increasing the knowledge and skill  of an employee for doing a particular job&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Training  is an organized activity for increasing knowledge and skills of people for a  definite purpose. It involves systematic procedures for transferring technical  know-how to employees so as to increase their knowledge and skills for doing a  specific job with proficiency. In other words, the trainees acquire technical  knowledge, skills and problem solving ability by undergoing the training  programme.<br>
    Training  is a: <br>
          Process of learning a sequence of  programmed behavior.<br>
          It is an application of knowledge. <br>
          It attempts to improve their performance  on current job or prepare them for an intended job. <br>
          Training is an organized process for  increasing the knowledge &amp; skills of people for doing a particular job. <br>
          It is a learning process involving the  acquisition of skills and attitudes<br>
          It is a continuous process<br>
          It is a service function, providing  management with professional support in meeting the organization&rsquo;s objectives<br>
          It is concerned with people, relationship  and organizational success<br>
    Development  refers to the learning opportunities designed to help employees grow while  Training refers to the process of imparting specific skills.<br>
    T&amp;D  offers competitive advantage to a firm by removing performance deficiencies;  making employees stay long; minimized accidents, scraps and damages; and  meeting future employee needs.</p>

  <p>From the above data it can be interpreted that the key concern of  any organization i.e. skill up-gradation through training, is quite a  successful in the organization. </p>
  <h1>Conclusion and Interpretaion</h1>
  <p>Based on the data collected after the  survey in administration block of BCW/CCW, statistically studying the data and  later on analyzing the data, Interpretation about the Training and Development  Programme developed by HR Department is as follows:<br>
    1.      Training  is provided to the individuals is On the Job training so that their attendance  is counted accordingly, rather than a leave to be awarded. <br>
    2.      The  individuals can themselves decide whatever the training programme they want to  attend but have to be informed to the HR Department. Also, department heads  decides to whom training programme is to be provided.<br>
    This shows that Department Heads are active  towards their sub-ordinates activities.<br>
    3.        Sharing of the views with peers and supervisors and installing those new ideas  in the daily working conditions is highly appreciable<br>
    This indicates the Healthy Working  Culture Environment among Supervisors; Peers and Sub-ordinates<br>
    4.      Agreeableness  towards T&amp;D Programme to be problem solving device and Enhancement in  self-productivity shows that employees are eager to work with the Changing  Culture and Technology of the society.</p>
  <h1>Suggestions</h1>
  <p>      Making training and development process an  entirely in house activity to reduce cost.<br>
          The trainees should fill the feedback form  and from time to time, test should be conducted to know the gauge of the  effectiveness of training to employee to check their memory if they retain  anything or not.<br>
          Stress management training should be more  emphasized for employee as it was observed that people are all the time in  tension like situation as: how to do, what to do, when to do, no time and  things like that which kept them tensed all time<br>
          Most importantly, during training session  employees are not co-operative and they tend to move out during the session for  their private works. Thus, a watch towards it is very essential.</p>
