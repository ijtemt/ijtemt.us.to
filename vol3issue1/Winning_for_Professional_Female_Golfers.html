This study used a two-stage data  envelopment analysis (DEA) approach: the first stage of this study involved  measuring the efficiency scores of female golfers, and the second stage of the  study used Tobit regression analysis to explain the variations in these  efficiencies. Eight of the examined golfers achieved an efficient approach,  whereas 103 golfers were inefficient. There were significantly positive effects  on efficiency scores from the following items: &ldquo;driving distance&rdquo;, &ldquo;driving  accuracy percentage&rdquo;, &ldquo;putts per round&rdquo;, and &ldquo;money leaders&rdquo;. Thus, both driving  and putting were determinants of success in LPGA tournaments in 2010.

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>The analysis of sports data provides a useful  application for econometric and managerial techniques (Nero, 2001). At the  highest level of competition, athletes must possess not only overall skill but  also sufficient logistical support; in other words, coordination of a wide variety  of factors is required to achieve perfect scores in competitions. To focus on  the training perspective, the first goal of modern golf training is to win the tournament; thus, for a golf coach to understand the technical  situation and demands of each athlete, the analysis of all types of competition  skills and statistics after the game has become very important. <br>
    Sport-related applications of analytical approaches  are interesting and entertaining; moreover, sports provide large quantities of  data for analytical purposes. In particular, there are applications of data  envelopment analysis (DEA) to baseball.  Anderson and Sharpe (1997) use DEA to evaluate  the performance of baseball hitters and calculate a composite batter index  (CBI). Studies have increasingly addressed and discussed a growing number of  baseball-related issues (Sexton &amp; Lewis, 2003; Lewis &amp; Sexton, 2004; Lewis,  Sexton, &amp; Lock,  2007; Lewis, Lock, &amp; Sexton, 2009). Fried, Lambrinos,  and Tyner (2004) utilized DEA to assess golfer performance but were not aware  of any applications of DEA to golf.<br>
    Nero (2001) used regression analysis to estimate  golfer earnings through an examination of four performance measures: putting  average, driving distance, driving accuracy and number of sand saves. Because  the assessment of golf techniques involves multi-level considerations and  numerous inputs and outputs, an increasing number of studies have been  employing DEA to investigate the performance of golfers. Fried et  al. (2004) examined the  performance under pressure and the personal competence of professional golfers  of the PGA (Professional Golf Association), the LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association) and the SPGA (Senior Professional Golf Association) tours of the United States in 1998. <br>
    Regression analysis is typically used to predict or  judge the directions and magnitudes of correlations between two variables,  whereas DEA is more frequently employed to determine the relative efficiency  among decision making units (DMUs); thus, these two research methods should be applied  to appropriately address distinct investigative topics. Coelli,  Rao and Battese (1998) observed that scholars in  the management field have generally adopted a two-stage method to assess the  influence of different management factors on efficiency. Lovell,  Walters and Wood (1995) summarised related literature that used the traditional  ordinary least squares (OLS) method of calculating regressions and found that the  efficiency values are largely estimated from corrections to the DEA model.  However, related literature revealed that if the least squares method is  adopted to estimate the value of the parameter, bias and  inconsistency are typically produced (Cooper,  Seiford &amp; Tone, 1999). Therefore, a  two-stage search for efficiency values can be adopted that generally produces  technical efficiency values that are smaller than 1; these values differ from  the unlimited range that is found for the dependent variables of the general  regression model. Thus, with the Tobit regression model (Tobin, 1958), which is a type of censored data model (also known as a limited dependent variables model), in  the regression analysis, the  aforementioned issues regarding the generation of bias and inconsistency can be  solved. <br>
    In summary, a two-stage DEA is adopted in this study to investigate the issue of  the game-participation efficiency of 2010 LPGA  golfers. In the first stage of  the study, DEA is applied to assess the game-participation efficiency of the  athletes and create efficiency rankings; in the second stage of the study, Tobit  regression is used to analyse and inspect determinants (which are also referred to as key  factors or winning factors) that affect the game-participation efficiencies of  the athletes. Through the analysis of the annual game-participation  efficiencies and determinants of winning for the examined athletes, this study  seeks to produce results that can be used as an important reference for  facilitating superior future performance. </p>
  <h1>METHODOLOGY </h1>
  <h2>Research Targets </h2>
  <p>This study sought to  analyse the complete annual performance of golfers who participated in the 2010 LPGA Tour. In particular, this investigation focused on the top  120 golfers in the money  rankings for 2010. Among these athletes, several golfers did not participate  for entire quarters of the year or retired during the course of the year (for  example, Lorena Ochoa retired in  2010 after only attending six tournaments); these golfers and certain athletes  with incomplete data were removed from the examined pool of golfers, reducing  the size of the pool to 111 golfers. </p>
  <h2>Data Envelopment Analysis </h2>
  <p>The methods that  economists employ to evaluate production efficiency and issues can be broadly  classified into the two categories: parametric approaches and non-parametric  approaches. DEA is a non-parametric  method that was first proposed by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (1978). Initially, this method assumed a situation involving  constant returns to scale (CRS);  subsequently, Banker, Charnes and Cooper (1984) expanded this  approach into a variable returns to scale (VRS) model. DEA does not require assumptions to be made  regarding the production function, and its only requirement is that the set of  production possibilities must be convex. Further, DEA employs a linear planning technique to  obtain the efficiency envelopment curve that is used as the basis for  evaluating the efficiency of each DMU, and it is applicable to the efficiency  assessment of multiple inputs and outputs. <br>
    Before DEA is used to  assess each DMU, the correlation between input and output is not determined;  hence, the output efficiency values reflect relative efficiency instead of  absolute efficiency. DEA can be utilized not only to calculate the efficiency  value of each DMU, but also to adjust the input and output variables of each  DMU in a way that maximises efficiency. Therefore, to achieve an optimal model  for assessing the game-participation efficiency of the golfers who participated  in the US LPGA in 2010, this study has chosen to employ DEA and has adopted a VRS  output-oriented model to obtain the DEA results. </p>
  <h2>Tobit Regression </h2>
  <p>Tobit regression analysis was proposed by Tobin in 1958. It is  applicable to the analysis of whether the dependent variable of a dataset is  segmented or sectioned. If this approach is used to assess efficiency values  that are between 0 and 1, this type of regression analysis may be regarded as a  limited dependent variables model or a censored data model  (Coelli et al., 1998). <br>
    To further investigate  the determinants of winning with respect to the game-participation efficiency  of LPGA athletes in 2010, the game-participation efficiency value of LPGA  athletes is used as the  dependent variable. As mentioned above, because the value of this dependent  variable is between 0 and 1, the regression model of this study can be considered  a censored data model or a limited dependent variables model. This  characterisation holds because, although the independent variable can  correspond to any observation value, the dependent variable will nonetheless  only incorporate a subset of the corresponding observation values; thus, even  if the limited observation value has a higher proportion, the expectation value  of the error item will not necessarily be zero (Powell,  1986). Traditionally,  certain studies in the extant literature have adopted the least squares method  for estimating parameter values; however, OLS will generate biases and inconsistency (Cooper et al., 1999). Therefore, to avoid these issues, this investigation  has adopted the Tobit regression as the empirical model for its analysis. <br>
    In the Tobit  regression empirical model of this study, the dependent variable is the technical efficiency (TE)  of each examined golfer. The  independent variables include events, money leaders (moneys), driving  distance (dd), driving  accuracy percentage (dap), greens  in regulation percentage (girp), sand  save percentage (ssp) and putts  per round (ppr). Hence, the Tobit  regression model of this  investigation may be expressed as follows: <br>
    <img src="Winning_for_Professional_Female_Golfers_clip_image002.gif" alt="A Study of the Performance and the Determinants of Winning for Professional Female Golfers" width="339" height="15"></p>
  <h2>Definition of Terms </h2>
  <p>Building on the work of Fried et al.  (2004), this study created  seven input and output evaluation indices. In particular, the variable of  events is the output index for this investigation, whereas the six items of  money leaders, driving distance, driving accuracy percentage, greens in  regulation percentage, sand save percentage and putts per round are the input  indices for this study. In the design of this research, the nature of the  indices was considered; for example, putts per round were converted to its  reciprocal value to achieve calculation consistency. Each input or output index  is defined in accordance with LPGA standards as  follows: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Events: the  annual number of events that were played in the 2010 LPGA Tour by an athlete. </li>
    <li>Money leaders:  the sum (in US dollars) of the annual monetary prizes that were earned by an  athlete during the 2010 LPGA Tour. </li>
    <li>Driving distance: an athlete&rsquo;s average  driving distance, in yards. </li>
    <li>Driving  accuracy percentage: the percentage of occasions on which an athlete drove her  golf ball from the tee to the fairway. </li>
    <li>Greens in  regulation percentage: the percentage of greens that an athlete reached in  regulation. </li>
    <li>Sand save  percentage: the percentage of occasions during which an athlete successfully  saved her golf ball from the sand after failing to reach the green in  regulation. </li>
    <li>Putts per  round: the average number of putts that an athlete required on the green during  the course of each round. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>RESULTS </h1>
  <h2>The Efficiency and Ranking of LPGA Golfers in 2010 </h2>
  <p>This  study investigated the game-participation performance and determinants (factors  that significantly affect performance and winnings) for LPGA Tour golfers in  2010. The original study target and evaluation index data were the top 120  highest earning athletes of 2010; after removing athletes who did not complete  a tournament for an entire quarter, those who retired and those who presented  insufficient data, 111 golfers remained in this study target. In total, seven  input/output evaluation indices were examined. The descriptive statistical  results are presented in Table 1. <br>
    First stage: This study  sought to assess the monetary rankings, game-participation efficiencies and  efficiency rankings of the examined LPGA athletes in 2010. Moreover, the input and output data for each athlete  were introduced into the DEA Solver (version 5.0) software package for calculations, and the variable  scale return output model was applied to generate technical efficiency  performance (Table 2). <br>
    There were eight game-participation efficient  athletes on the LPGA Tour in 2010: Na Yeon Choi was first, Jiyai Shin was  second, Cristie Kerr was third, Yani Tseng was fourth, Suzann Pettersen was  fifth, Ai Miyazato was sixth, Michelle Wie was ninth and Vicky Hurst was 28th in the money rankings for the LPGA  for this year. The efficiency values for these eight athletes are all equal to  1, indicating that these athletes are relatively efficient; that is, their  input/output ratio is relatively maximised. The efficient values for these  game-participation efficient athletes are all located at the same equal-output  curved surface and form a reference set; this set may be used for comparisons  involving athletes who have not achieved game-participation efficiency. <br>
    The technical skills of athletes who have not  achieved efficient game-participation merit further reinforcement and  promotion. <br>
    Except  for Yani Tseng, who has achieved game-participation efficiency, none of the  other Taiwanese golfers on the LPGA Tour in 2010, including Candie Kung (money  ranking: 36th place; efficiency value: 0.382; efficiency ranking: 60), Amy Hung  (money ranking: 48th place; efficiency value: 0.233; efficiency ranking: 83)  and Teresa Lu (money ranking: 63rd place; efficiency value: 0.330; efficiency  ranking: 67) demonstrated efficient game-participation. In addition, Yu-Ping  Lin did not participate in tournaments during 2010. </p>
  <h2>Determinants  that Affected the Efficiency of LPGA Golfers in 2010 </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>In the second stage of this study, a Tobit  regression model was applied to identify and assess the influential factors  (Table 3) that affected the monetary performance of LPGA golfers in 2010. In  this process, the technical efficiency value of each of the 111 examined  golfers from the first stage of the analysis was used as the dependent  variable. Accumulated years of experience, height and nationality of the  athletes were examined as environmental variables for predicting  game-participation performance, but no significant results were obtained for  these factors. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Therefore, in the Tobit regression  model of this study, the input-output index that was obtained in the first  stage of the analysis is selected as an independent variable to determine the  influential factors (determinants) of the game-participation performance by the  athletes. From Table 3, it can be observed that at a significance level of 1%,  positive correlations may be observed between efficiency and each of the  following factors: driving accuracy percentage, driving distance, money leaders  and putts per round. The importance of driving distance with respect to  efficiency was in accordance with the modern trend of power-oriented play,  whereas the correlation between the game-participation efficiency of LPGA  golfers and the putts per round factor was in accordance with the results of  Fried et al. (2004). In both the current study and this earlier investigation,  this finding demonstrated that putting technique is a highly important and  influential aspect of the LPGA game.<br>
    The events factor demonstrates a  significant negative correlation to the game-participation performance of LPGA  athletes, implying that this index was not able to enhance the  game-participation efficiency of the examined golfers. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Moreover, an insignificant correlation is observed between golfer  efficiency and either of the two indices of greens in regulation percentage and  sand save percentage. </li>
  </ul>
  <h1>DISCUSSION AND  CONCLUSIONS </h1>
  <h2>The Efficiency and Ranking of LPGA Golfers in 2010 </h2>
  <p>In the first stage of this study, there were eight golfers who reached  efficiency on the LPGA Tour in 2010: Na Yeon Choi was first, Jiyai Shin was  second, Cristie Kerr was third, Yani Tseng was fourth, Suzann Pettersen was  fifth, Ai Miyazato was sixth, Michelle Wie was ninth and Vicky Hurst was 28th  in the money rankings for the LPGA in 2010. For athletes with an efficiency  value of 1, the input resource is efficiently located in the LPGA context for  the entire year; that is, the input events and all of the technical  performances have reached an efficient output. The Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng  was one of the golfers who led the rankings of efficient game-participation;  this fact helps explain the origins of her outstanding scores and performance.  In addition, in the future, if clear rankings of the efficient athletes must be  determined, various research methods, such as assessments of super efficiency,  can be used to obtain these rankings.<br>
    There were 103 golfers who were relatively inefficient, and their  technical performance level must still be enhanced and promoted. Therefore,  this study focused on investigating the efficiency of these golfers. In fact,  suggestions regarding the extent of improvement and the reference learning  targets that can be achieved for these inefficient golfers may be acquired  through slack variable analysis, scale return analysis and assessments of the  reference set; this topic is a future research direction that follows from the  current investigation. </p>
  <h4>Except for Yani Tseng, who has  been efficient, other Taiwanese golfers did not achieve game-participation  efficiency. In particular, these other athletes include Candie Kung (money  ranking: 36th place; efficiency value: 0.382; efficiency ranking: 60), Amy Hung  (money ranking: 48th place; efficiency value: 0.233; efficiency ranking: 83)  and Teresa Lu (money ranking: 63rd place; efficiency value: 0.330; efficiency  ranking: 67). Although Yu-Ping Lin did not participate in the LPGA Tour in  2010, the number of Taiwanese golfers who participated in the Tour did not  change because Yani Tseng was a new participant. All of the examined Taiwanese  athletes demonstrated significant enhancements in both money ranking and  efficiency, indicating the enhancement of the golf technique and  competitiveness of Taiwanese LPGA golfers. This development augurs well for the  future environment of women&rsquo;s professional golf in Taiwan. </h4>
  <h2>Determinants that Affected the Efficiency of LPGA  Golfers in 2010 </h2>
  <p>This study initially established the three variables of accumulated  years of experience, athlete height and athlete nationality as the  environmental parameters for predicting game-participation performance; however,  none of these variables proved to be significantly related to performance.  Therefore, the second stage of this investigation utilized the input/output  index from the DEA of the first stage of the study as the independent variable,  and the Tobit regression model was used to obtain key factors that influenced  the monetary performance of LPGA golfers in 2010. <br>
    Driving accuracy percentage and driving distance were both significantly  correlated with golfer efficiency, demonstrating the prominence of driving  distance for LPGA athletes and emphasising the importance of improvements in  golf equipment, scientific training and weight training for facilitating the  development of greater power for professional golfers. Driving distance and  accuracy considerations provide the primary explanations for why the strength  of the competition in women&rsquo;s professional golf is rapidly approaching the  level of competition for male golfers. Moreover, the importance of these  factors disproves the assertion, promulgated by Fried et al. (2004), that  driving distance is merely a publicity stunt. <br>
    Money leaders are positively correlated with golfer efficiency; that is,  the examined golfers who obtain greater earnings demonstrate superior  performance. This finding is in accordance with prior expectations and verified  the hypotheses of this study regarding the game-participation efficiency and  monetary awards of the examined athletes. <br>
    Putts per round are positively correlated to the efficiency of LPGA  golfers. This result was not only consistent with the findings of Fried et al.  (2004), who also employed the DEA research method, but also supported the  viewpoint &ldquo;drive for show, putt for money&rdquo;, implying that putting technique has  a role and importance that will affect the results in distinct golfing  associations, such as the PGA and LPGA, and in various tournaments. <br>
    The events factor is significantly negatively correlated with golfer  efficiency, indicating that this factor does not enhance the competitive  performance of the examined golfers. In other words, the viewpoint of many  athletes, that enhanced competitive performance should result from more events,  was not supported, and strategic efficiency appears to be a more important  consideration with respect to athletic performance.<br>
    Further, an insignificant correlation was observed  between efficiency and the examined indices of greens in regulation percentage  and sand save percentage. This finding shows that shot-making skills and sand  save percentages were not the primary influences for efficient golfing  performance; thus, these skills were not the key techniques for determining the  probabilities of winning on the LPGA Tour in 2010. In a prior study that  compared different research methodologies, sand save percentage was found to  yield a result that completely opposed initial predictions. </p>
  <h1>Conclusions </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>The  efficiency rankings of LPGA golfers in 2010: </li>
    <li>Eight  of the studied LPGA athletes reached maximum relative efficiency in 2010 (including Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng, who was in  fourth place in the money rankings for the year). </li>
    <li>One hundred and three golfers did not attain  game-participation efficiency (including domestic athletes Candie Kung, who was  in 36th place in the money rankings for the year; Amy Hung, who was in 48th  place in the money rankings for the year; and Teresa Lu, who was in 63rd place in  the money rankings for the year). </li>
    <li>The determinants that affected the efficiency of LPGA  golfers in 2010 were: </li>
    <li>Significant  positive correlations were found among driving accuracy percentage, driving  distance, monetary awards and putts per round. This result demonstrates that  trends towards increased power and putting skill are not only the key factors  that affected the efficiency of LPGA golfers in 2010, but also important factors in determining monetary  rewards (as both driving and putting considerations were  correlated with monetary awards). The  two-stage approach of this study has thus verified an important hypothesis  regarding monetary leaders. </li>
    <li>There was a  significant negative correlation between the events factor and the  game-participation performance of the athletes, indicating that this technical  index cannot enhance athlete efficiency. Instead, the game-participation  strategy of the athlete throughout the entire year is a more critical concern. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The greens in regulation percentage and sand save  percentage did not appear to exert any significant influence on golfer efficiency.</p>
  <h1>Suggestions </h1>
  <p>This study examines the performance of LPGA golfers in 2010. In the  first stage of this investigation, DEA is adopted to calculate the efficiency  value of each examined athlete; in the second stage, a Tobit regression  approach that uses a censored data model is adopted to investigate the external  environmental factors (determinants) that affect the monetary performance of  2010 LPGA golfers. This approach differs from the method adopted by Fried et  al., (2004), who used only monetary winnings as a dependent variable for  predicting golfer performance. However, this study further analysed the  efficiency of the golfers using a model with restricted data and limited  dependent variables, and this investigation constitutes the first example of  this approach in the field of sports research. Thus, the results of this study  may be used as a reference for future research and or for various concepts and  applications. <br>
    Various research methods may be used in the future to rank the  performance of efficient athletes, such as assessments of super efficiency or  fuzzy measurements. The extent of improvement that is possible for golfers and  the appropriate reference and learning targets for these athletes can be  estimated using slack variable analysis, scale return analysis and examination  of the reference set. These approaches and methods warrant further  investigation. <br>
    The findings of the current study indicate that, at the present time,  driving skill and putting skill are key determinants of the efficiency of LPGA  golfers. Due to the rapid advancement of modern technology, the distance and  difficulty of golf courses are continuously being enhanced; thus, the skills  required of golfers are also continually evolving, with respect to driving  distance, driving accuracy, and shot-making skills. As a result, the continual  tracking of LPGA-related technical factors, including the analysis and  investigation of the influence of different environmental variables, should  occur. (For instance, this study has investigated items such as accumulated  years of experience, height and nationality.) In addition, professional golf  for male athletes at different competitive levels, such as the Asian Tour, the  European Tour and the US PGA Tour, may also merit future study. <br>
    In 2011, the  performance of Taiwanese athlete Yani Tseng, who was champion of the LPGA Tour,  was very impressive. Her efficiency and performance with respect to the various  determinants examined in this study were markedly different to those of her  competitors. Such outstanding performances should be analysed and the data  stored in a database that includes information over the long term; in other  words, the performance of golfers should be continuously monitored, to harness  information for strategy and analysis. The findings from this database can also  be utilized as an important reference for conducting training and developing  competitive skills. The eventual goal of these suggested measures is to enhance  the competitiveness and visibility of Taiwanese athletes in international golf. </p>
