  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Brand  was a customer experience represented by collection of images and ideas. Or it  basically refers to symbol as- name, logo, slogan, design. It has one strategic  purpose and that was to differentiate itself from competitors.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">In this  study political parties can be viewed as brands. And politicians were the  products. All, of them, segments markets, and then try to target them. They  have different strategies for different segments, where some fail and some  succeed. BJP, congress, BSP, AIADMK, JD, etc were considered as brands in the  report. These were the competing brands fighting for one goal. They have  various products wiz the politicians. BJP was formed in 1951 under leadership  of Dr.Syama Prasad Mukherjee. They have the philosophy of Integral Humanism and  Hindutva. BJP had formed government in central for 3 times till now. It was the  biggest opposition party currently. Under the nurturing of umbrella&nbsp; BJP&nbsp;  there was a rise of a product that becomes a brand of its own. And that  powerful sub-brand was &ndash; &ldquo;MODI&rdquo; who became CM of one of the richest state of  India- Gujarat, on October 2001 after Keshubhaipatel resigned. Modi was  re-elected on December 2002 with 126 seats out of 182.&nbsp; Modi says security and development was  complementary and women, youth, tribal and fishermen included in marketing  segment. Market targeting addressed all women rallies in which he talked about  reduction in women infanticides, increase in women literacy. There was Tribals  and fishermen- Vanbandhuyojna and Sagarkheduyojna. Also launched Vanthanbhi  Vikasyatra to gauge the mood of rural population and image was development or  hindutva! Both these issues helped alot. But it was more because of development  work Modi has taken. The state CM could very well be on his way to become the  next PM. But there were various hurdles get to be tackled with.</p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Literature  Riview</h1>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">BS  Reporter (2014) said that &quot;SMEs must understand the importance of  branding. Now, branding was not only restricted to advertising for television,  print media or radio. SMEs must promote its products through social media which  was very effective. It was centered on the objectives of knowledge-sharing and  the best practices to enhance competitiveness of the small and medium  entrepreneurs in association with Business Standard. </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">A K  Bhattacharya (2014) the new government would do well to concentrate on framing  its own agenda for action, instead of looking back to review decisions that its  predecessor had taken. The new government would do well to concentrate on  framing its own agenda for action, instead of looking back to review decisions  that its predecessor had taken. There would naturally be a lot of pressure on  it to review many such decisions. That exercise may be necessary in many cases,  but the new government would be ill-advised to concentrate all its energy on  such actions. Leadership, after all, was not about changing whatever was done  in the past; it was about charting a new path for growth and development.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">While  elaborating importance of branding and social media Kakkar (2014) said,&quot;  Social media was very cost effective as compared to other advertisement  mediums&rdquo;. Social media has become a platform for personalized engagement with  SMEs. Branding can contribute in this area significantly. This was a smartest  way to engage with the target community. The capability of social media was  immense for SMEs. As they can target their potential markets according to the  regional specifications.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">Vinay  Umarji &amp; Premal Balan (January 1, 2014) said that brand 'Namo' was finding  its place in day-to-day utilities like stainless steel utensils to sweets.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The  objective behind this was to support Modi and this has nothing to do with  business.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">'The  Namo Store', the portal will have products that will carry both a utility and a  social message surrounding Modi. They believe in the values and vision to bring  in, such as the 'India First' attitude. Through this they are developing  products for old age people.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">BS  Reporter&nbsp; on January 13, 2013&nbsp; With Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2013 focusing on  development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Gujarat, chief minister  Narendra Modi&nbsp; encouraged entrepreneurs  to come together and create a &lsquo;Made in Gujarat-India&rsquo; brand for products  manufactured by SMEs.&ldquo;We have to create a brand of &lsquo;Made in Gujarat-India&rsquo; on  the lines of &lsquo;Made in Japan&rsquo;. The brand creation would represent state SMEs and  assure good quality and credibility,&rdquo; said Modi. To meet the manpower  requirement of industries, the state government will also set up skill  development centers close to industrial clusters. The government was also  looking to make changes in the academic syllabus for the institutes and  universities.</p>
  <h1 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;">Research  Methodology</h1>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To  study Modi&rsquo;s personality&rsquo;s link with society.</li>
    <li>To  study branding strategy of Modi.</li>
    <li>To  study how Modi uses social media to create his brand.</li>
    <li>To  study the characteristics of building brand Modi on voters in the general  loksabha election 2014.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An  exploratory research was carried out regarding Modi, in which everything was  clearly define. No vague ideas or statement were used. The questionnaire was  circulated among the various people of Bhimtal ,so that their responses can be  achieved to conduct the study. In that questionnaire certain close ended  questions and one open ended question were asked to the respondents. Likert  scale was also used in the research study.

  <h5>Conclusion</h5>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">This  project was helpful in proving the in differentiation between the Modi and  brand Modi. Through this we got to know that Modi can be hawked in the  political market as a product that provides high yields over short and long  terms. He was a super performing product who embodies power, precision and  aggression. Modi as from a very poor family and from his journey from tea  seller up till now had set a great example for all of us that if a person  decides to achieve something then by their hardwork, smart skills can achieve  it. Modi had assured people to bring good governance in the country by using  certain strategies and policies framed by&nbsp;  him and also by his team member&rsquo;s good performance. A savvy marketer  with a sense of humour, a decisive administrator, a non-negotiable commander, a  believer of innovation, a progressive reformist, Brand Modi was a little bit of  everything. Whether he emerges as the brand of choice was something the nation  will get to see on May 16.</p>
  <p class="MsoBodyText">The  general election commission brought a drastic change in the loksabha election  by different mode of casting votes to the parties. Through this Modi has come  up in the eyes of society and also in news and grap the publicity. And there  was a unipolar voting towards one candidate. People as coming all over the  caste, creed, sex, ratios has given one party winning. In this election 2014,  the voting ratio has increased and changed the youth mentality and their  thoughts. Modi has successfully created the positioning of his image in minds  of voters which has created a Brand for Modi from Modi.</p>
