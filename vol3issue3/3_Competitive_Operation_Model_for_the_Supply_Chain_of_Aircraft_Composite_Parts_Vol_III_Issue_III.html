  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>    Although  the number of new transport aircraft sold in a given year has &ldquo;whip-sawed&rdquo; over  the past decade, production and deliveries have trended steadily upward. As  seen in Figure 1, this trend will continue in the coming decade. Aircraft  manufacturers are expected to deliver more than 17,000 aircraft (including  dedicated cargo planes) between 2012 and 2022. About 60 percent of these  aircraft will replace aging aircraft. [1] <br>
    <img width="375" height="215" src="3_Competitive_Operation_Model_for_the_Supply_Chain_of_Aircraft_Composite_Parts_Vol_III_Issue_III_clip_image004.jpg" alt="Fig 1: Historic and forecasted commercial aircraft unit deliveries. Although the number of new transport aircraft sold in a given year has “whip-sawed” over the past decade, the general trend is upward, and will continue to rise through 2022. Source: Composites Forecasts and Consulting LLC  "><br>
    Figure 1 Demand of Transport Aircraft [1]<br>
    A  recent challenge in aerospace engineering is the trend to switch from  predominantly aluminum to predominantly composite structures, as evidenced by  the development of the Boeing B787 and the Airbus A350 XWB (Extra Wide Body).  From the manufacturing perspective, this is a major step change since it  imposes the need to create and update existing knowledge bases to adapt  industry to this new demand. [2]<br>
    For  commercial planes, composites penetration continues in new design as composites  are applied to all critical parts. This trend is driven by the positive  economic global impact of composites - weight reduction leading to fuel cost  savings. [3]<br>
    Composite materials used in commercial airplanes typically are produced  by combining layers of carbon or glass fibers with epoxy. In recent years,  manufacturers have expanded the use of composites to the fuselage and wings  because these materials are typically lighter and more resistant to corrosion  than are the metallic materials that have traditionally been used in airplanes. The percentage of total structural weight attributed to composites  show as Figure 2. [4] <br>
    <img width="368" height="278" src="3_Competitive_Operation_Model_for_the_Supply_Chain_of_Aircraft_Composite_Parts_Vol_III_Issue_III_clip_image006.jpg"> Figure 2 Commercial Airplane Models over  time by Percentage of Composites. [4] <br>
    Bombardier&rsquo;s International Composite Centers  of Excellence includes 6 main manufacturing plants with Composite manufacturing  facilities for civil aircraft structures. They structure for composites new product  development approaches. They focus on the quality of the manufacturing process;  enhance the quality of the interfaces and communications with all internal  resources; follow a disciplined project management approach; reduce time to  market and minimizing engineering changes following design freeze. [5]</p>
  <p>      The business opportunity for increased use of  composites - aero-engine components. The company sees a long-term trend towards  lighter engines, featuring lower speed, higher-diameter fans, in order to meet  fuel consumption and emissions targets over the coming years. The advantages of  carbon fiber epoxy in this context is that it is 66% lighter than titanium, its  properties can be tailored to critical load/stiffness directions, and carbon  fiber is inherently resistant to fatigue loading. [6]</p>
  <p>    The  demand trend of civil aircraft is stable and increase in the future years. Due  to the material technology development and fuel price volatility, the  composites material become more important in aero-structures, also starting to  apply in the aero-engine.  It is the good  opportunity to construct a robust and efficient supply chain of composite parts  in the aerospace industry.</p>
  <h1>Competitive Operation  Model </h1>
  <p>Structural  airworthiness is the first aspect in airworthiness certification for composite  material structure which has particular devisable performance, togetherness of  material and structure, multiplicity of potential failure modes and lack of  regularity, sensitivity to out-of-plane loads and to operating environment. The  items of structural airworthiness regulation are established on above key  problems and have close relations with the improved knowledge of safety for  aircraft structure. In the period of service life, structure must be designed  to bear limit load and meet the rigidity requirement in the appropriate  environment, this is not only applied to new structure and also to aging  structure. [7]<br>
    Due  to the following reasons, we have to create the Competitive Operation Model for  the supply chain of aircraft composite parts.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Aerospace industry utilize more composite materials: New design  aircraft such as A380, A350, B787, C-Series apply more composite materials in  aero-structure. The aero-engine has started to apply composite materials.</li>
    <li>Shelf life constraint is critical to the quality of details parts  and components: so reserve and acquire the material in time and keep a suitable/reasonable  inventory level for production turn around are essential for the effective  supply chain. </li>
    <li>High capital investment in composite: The main facility in  composite shop, including clean room, autoclave, auto-layup machine, 5-axis  trimming machine, the purchase cost and invest are high. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The procedures of aircraft  composite parts include the material procurement, fabrication process, supply chain  management, components assembly and final assembly. </p>
  <p>This  study construct and propose Competitive Operation Model, shows as Figure 3. We  describe the material procurement in section 3, explain the fabrication  process in section 4, design the supply chain management in section 5, develop  the component assembly in section 6, and discuss the final assembly in section  7. </p>

  <h1>Figure 3 Competitive Operation Model </h1>
  <h1> Material Procurement </h1>
  <p>The  major raw material for composite parts production are prepregs, resin,  honeycomb...etc., shows as Figure 4. Those materials have to store inside the  temperature control container (e.g. ice box) during the shipment and storage.  Even exposure in the room temperature, we have to measure/count and control the  shelf life until enter the autoclave and start the curing cycle.<br>
    <img width="319" height="192" src="3_Competitive_Operation_Model_for_the_Supply_Chain_of_Aircraft_Composite_Parts_Vol_III_Issue_III_clip_image010.gif"><br>
    Figure 4 The Raw Material-  Prepreg [8]<br>
    If  the composite production shops are located far away from the raw material  supplier, such as emerging area. The material procurement become a critical  issue for stable and smooth production.</p>
  <h2>Target</h2>
  <p>Due  to the most of raw materials are shelf life control, so the target of material procurement  is provide the right quantity of material in the right timing to ensure the  production quality is qualified and stable. </p>
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>The  whole process should focus on shelf life control, including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Inventory and consuming control.</li>
    <li>Delivery/shipment process control.</li>
    <li>Prepreg group cutting/lay-up and curing.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>The  solution of the whole aircraft material procurement should take the following  actions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The aircraft manufacturer should link with material suppliers in  design/develop stage of the new model to select the suitable materials.</li>
    <li>The aircraft manufacturer should forecast his long term demand and  secure the continuously supply of raw material from those suppliers.</li>
    <li>Aircraft manufacturer should group the demand of aero-structures  suppliers to negotiate and deal with the price with raw material supplier to  control the cost and resources.</li>
    <li>The aero-structures suppliers should alliance with raw material  supplier and build the consignment inventory near the place of those composite  shops to acquire the benefit of shelf life control.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1> Fabrication Process</h1>
  <p>The  fabrication process include prepreg cutting, lay-up, curing, trimming and  cutting, non-destroy inspection, post treatment and painting, shows as Figure 5.   The process is continuous and technological  intensive. The Production Planning has to integrate the production resources to  ensure start and complete on time. The Production Engineering has to improve  the process to reduce the cost in competitive level.<br>
    <img width="326" height="244" src="3_Competitive_Operation_Model_for_the_Supply_Chain_of_Aircraft_Composite_Parts_Vol_III_Issue_III_clip_image012.jpg" alt="A350 crown panel skin lay up"><br>
    Figure 5 Fabrication Process-Cutting  [9]</p>
  <h2>Target</h2>
  <p>Due  to the whole fabrication process should satisfy the requirement of  specification and meet the mechanical/ chemical property. So the stable process  can improve the quality and increase the yield rate. Also, improve the process  and can control the product in the target cost. </p>
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>The  whole process should focus on process control, including:<br>
    1)      Production sequence and control.<br>
    2)      Production recipe and methodology.<br>
    3)      Environment control of working area.</p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>The  solution of the whole fabrication process should take the following actions:<br>
    1)      Production Engineering should understand  the lean production skill to improve the process and reduce the cost.<br>
    2)      Production Control should merge all the  demand from different customers, then manage and level the frustration load  into stable/smooth load.<br>
    3)      Aero-structures suppliers should consider  the characteristics of products and introduce some automation machines or  facilities to labor intensive operations, such as auto-layup, robot, NC  machine…etc. <br>
    4)      The environment control of clean room (e.g.  temperature, humidity…etc.), periodic calibration and Preventive Maintenance of  critical equipment/machines (e.g. autoclaves, NC routers, NDI scanner…etc.) are  important for the production. </p>
  <h1>Supply Chain Management</h1>
  <p>The  aircraft manufacturer and primary supplier should determine the core  competences. They can concentrate the resources in high value added categories. Figure  6 shows the value chain of composite process. Some non-core business, such as overload  job or operation, raw materials shipment, standard parts…etc. can off load or  purchase from suppliers.<br>
    <img width="364" height="208" src="3_Competitive_Operation_Model_for_the_Supply_Chain_of_Aircraft_Composite_Parts_Vol_III_Issue_III_clip_image014.jpg"><br>
    Figure 6 Value Chain of  Process [10]</p>
  <h2>Target</h2>
  <p>Due  to the procurement and outsourcing items can provide the company quality  products at target price, so it will benefit the aircraft manufacturer and  primary supplier concentrate in their expertise and value added items.</p>
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>The  whole supplier chain management should focus on quality requirements and cost  control:<br>
    1)      Supplier certification and qualification.<br>
    2)      Performance monitoring and  evaluation.<br>
    3)      Risk management. </p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>The  solution of the whole aircraft supply chain management should take the  following actions:<br>
    1)      Aircraft manufacturers should certify and  survey periodically the quality system of suppliers.<br>
    2)      Aircraft manufacturers should forecast  their long term demand of aircraft market and flow down to the supply chain.<br>
    3)      Aircraft manufacturers send  representatives on-site the critical suppliers to witness and find potential  risk.<br>
    4)      Aircraft manufacturers should help their  supplier to reduce the cost and achieve the win-win situation. </p>

  <p>   The component assembly process include the  operation from bushing/bearing install, sub-assembly to component at aero-structures  supplier site. Figure 7 shows components assembly in assembly line. After quality  check and on-site representative buyoff, then delivery to main aircraft  manufacturer. </p>

  <h2>Target</h2>
  <p>Because  of there are several models/components with different rate in the assembly line  of aero-structures supplier. The target of component assembly is allocate the  human resource and keep the flexibility to support the fluctuation in the  assembly line. </p>
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>The  whole process should focus on resource allocation, including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Crew load evaluation.</li>
    <li>Line balance.</li>
    <li>Learning curve monitoring.</li>
    <li>Discipline education and cross training. </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>The solution of the components assembly should take  the following actions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Base on the customer demand (time and quantity) to calculate the  load and capacity analysis. Allocate the suitable workforce to perform the  operation.</li>
    <li>Apply the lean production technology to reduce the waste and construct  the flow line. Consider to build moving line in high product rate  projects/components.</li>
    <li>Record the quality defects, working hours of each shipset to  monitoring the long term performance.</li>
    <li>Apply the information technology to display the assembly progress  and logistic support. From the foreman, shop leader, top manager can receive  the same information and keep the visibility of performance and current  progress.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>   Final Assembly </h1>
  <p><strong>   </strong>The aircraft  receive the components from different suppliers and proceed the final assembly process,  testing, painting, fly test and delivery to customers/airlines. Figure 8 shows  final assembly of civil aircraft.</p>
  <h2>Target</h2>
  <p>Due to meet the customer needs is very  important to gain the revenue and reputation, so the aircraft manufacturer has  to keep the dependability and keep the market share. If late to lunch a new  model aircraft or delivery the aircraft, it will cause penalty and canceled the  orders by the customer.</p>
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <p>The whole final assembly smooth and stable  production, including:<br>
    1)      Quick  response.<br>
    2)      Risk  management and backup plan.<br>
    3)      Logistic  supports.<br>
    4)      Functional  group integration.<br>

    Figure  8 Final Assembly [12]</p>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Solution</em></li>
  </ol>
  <p>The solution of the final assembly should take the  following actions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Base on the assembly schedule, the components, purchase parts, fasteners,  sealants…etc. should arrive shop floor on time.</li>
    <li>Monitor detail schedule for the critical path and warning any  issue will stop the line to management level.</li>
    <li>Different functional groups sent the authorized representatives  on-site the final assembly to work as a team to solve any issues which stop the  line.</li>
    <li>Dig out the potential risks and prepare the backup plan, monitor  the risk till vanished.</li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Conclusion </h1>
  <p><strong>   </strong>The demand trend of civil aircraft is stable and increase in the future  years. Due to the material technology development and fuel price volatility,  the composites material become more important in aero-structures, also starting  to apply in the aero-engine. It is the good opportunity and right timing to  integrate the supply chain in the aircraft composite parts. <br>
    This  study provides the Competitive Operation Model, which introduce the concepts of  value stream and lean production into the supply chain process and management  process for aircraft manufacturers and aero- structure suppliers. <br>
    In  each stage of value chain, this study provide the direction and solutions. Thus  the aircraft manufacturer and their suppliers can increase the performance and  competence in the competitive market. </p>
