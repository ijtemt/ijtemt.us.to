  <p><em>Abstract</em>—Since 2009, the Obama&rsquo;s Administration carried out the new growth  strategy to drag the U.S. economy out of the imbalanced and sluggish growth  dilemma from the recession. For the 5-year-implementation of the measures, this  paper draws the framework and summarizes the main measures applied. Further,  the comprehensive assessment of the strategic effects shows that the strategy  has played a positive role on accelerating the economic recovery, reducing the  internal and external imbalance, expanding exports, revitalizing the  substantive economy and promoting the sustainable economy development. But the  federal government still needs to face the challenges. Finally, this paper  discusses the implications of U.S. growth strategy to China&rsquo;s economy  transformation, industry development, international cooperation, and  sustainable and balanced growth in the post-crisis era. <br>
    <strong><em>Keywords-New </em></strong><strong><em>strategy; Sustainable  and balanced growth; External balance; Internal balance; Innovation growth; Energy  strategy</em></strong></p>
  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>The  U.S. economy has become increasingly imbalanced since the 1990s. In 2008, the  saving rate of United States was rising to 70.1% with the consumption rate  falling to 14.5%. And international industry transfers have contributed to the  U.S. substantive economy shrinking. The ratio of the manufacturing sector in  GDP has dropped from the peak of 28.3% in 1953 to 11.2% in 2009.  In the crisis period, the weak consumption expenditure and manufacturing  shrinking caused seriously insufficient power for its economic recovery. On the  other hand, the &quot;debt economic growth mode&quot; of U.S. economy in the  past years resulted in large fiscal deficit and foreign debt. In the fiscal  year 2009, the U.S. fiscal deficit reached as much as $1.41 trillion, with the  federal debt scale reaching more than $3.3 trillion. The current-account deficit was as high as $376.5 billion, which accounted for  2.7% of GDP in 2009.<br>
    Facing  the financial crisis, which dragged the U.S. economy into the dilemma of imbalanced  and sluggish growth, as well as the challenge of global climate change, the  U.S. President Barack Obama put forward the &quot;Framework of Sustainable and  Balanced Development Initiative&rdquo; before the G20 Summit 2009 in Pittsburgh and  implemented the sustainable and balanced growth strategy and related measures  in United States.<br>
    With  5-year-implementation of the new strategy, has the U.S. macro-economy got out  of recession? Have the internal and external imbalance been improved? How about  the sustainable growth? What kind of challenge does U.S. government still need  to face? As the second-largest economy in the world, China now is also facing  the issues of sustainable and balanced economic growth. The question for China  is whether China can get enlightenments from the U.S. strategy and measures for  government policies and cooperation with other nations? This paper is going to  suggest the answers. <br>
    Starting from  the framework of Obama&rsquo;s new strategy and main measures, the paper makes an  overall assessment of the strategic effects on accelerating economic recovery,  reducing the fiscal deficit, expanding exports, the revitalizing of the  substantive economy, saving energy and reducing emissions, etc. Based on the  analysis of current situation of China&rsquo;s economy, this paper finally discusses  the enlightenment of the U.S. strategy and gives recommendations to China. </p>
  <h1>Strategic Framework, Main  Policies and Measures</h1>
  <h2>Strategic Framework </h2>
  <p>    With  the goal of sustainable and balanced economic growth, Obama&rsquo;s new strategy framework  contains four economic parts (<em>See Figure  1</em>):<br>
    (1)&quot;Internal Balance Strategy&quot;,  aiming at reducing the deficit; (2)&quot;Reindustrialization Strategy&quot;, referring  to the revitalization of the substantive economy; (3)&quot;Export Expansion Strategy&quot;,  to balance the external economy through promoting export; (4)&quot;Innovation  and Green Growth Strategy&quot;, to develop clean energy technologies and industries. <br>

  <h2>Main Policies and Measures</h2>
  <p>(1) Accelerating Recovery and Internal Balance <strong> </strong><br>
    The Obama&rsquo;s Administration has adopted a  series of expansionary fiscal policies to accelerate the economy to recover  from the financial crisis, such as the release of  The  Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,  etc., costing more than $3 trillion in total. The U.S. government also implemented  four rounds of Quantitative Easing Monetary Policies(QE) since November 2008. <br>
    However, with the increasingly serious  problem of fiscal cliff along with the implementation of the stimulus measures,  the federal government took $2.5 trillion deficit-reduction measures on tax  increases and expenditure cuts in the past two years, including the Automatic  Deficit Reduction Mechanism 2013 as well as the structural adjustment of fiscal  expenditure, and reducing military and government administrative expenses, to  cut the budget deficits. <br>
    (2)Promoting  Exports and FTA  Negotiations<br>
    To alleviate the huge U.S. trade deficit, Obama  launched a government-wide National Export Strategy through the National Export  Initiative (NEI) in 2010, which aims at doubling the U.S. export to $3.14  trillion and creating two million jobs in 2014. Assisting the private sector, especially  the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises to export is the first priority to realize  the target. For example, the U.S. International Trade Administration dispatched 135  trade delegations to 55 countries, creating more than $22 billion export  earnings directly. In 2012, the export-import bank provided for $6.1 billion  financial support to 3300 small enterprises. <br>
    Negotiation of &ldquo;Free Trade Agreement&quot;  (FTA) is another essential component of the United States to expand exports. So  far, the United States government has signed 14 bilateral FTA with 20 countries.  And three multilateral FTA are ongoing: &quot; Trans-Pacific Partnership  Agreement &quot; (TPP), &quot; Transatlantic Trade and Investment  Partnership&quot; (TTIP), and &quot;Trade In Services Agreement (TiSA)&quot;.  The U.S. government expects to strengthen world-wide cooperation to remove  trade barriers for American companies through &quot;high standard and wide  range&quot; agreements covering all the competitive industries of U.S., such as  finance, education, healthcare, media and so on. At the same time, The U.S.  government continued promoting &quot;the United States&rsquo; Middle East and North  Africa Trade and Investment Partnership (MENA TIP) &quot;, &quot;the US-ASEAN Trade  and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)&quot; and participating in  &quot;Indonesia APEC Summit 2013&quot; to deepen cooperation of trade and  investment with African and Asian countries. Thus, through the worldwide FTA  negotiations covering America, Europe, Africa, and Asia, the U.S. government  has been devoting efforts to open the global market for the domestic companies. <br>
    (3) Reviving the Substantive Economy<br>
    The U.S. manufacturing  industry is considered as the base of the substantive economy and the engine of  the innovation, from where 90% of the patents and 70% of the private sector  R&amp;D activities come from.  As a result, the U.S. government emphasized the revitalization of &quot;Made in  USA&quot; as the core of the revitalization of the substantive economy. The  U.S. President Barack Obama signed the &quot;U.S. <em>Manufacturing</em> Enhancement Act&quot; on August 11, 2010, temporarily cancelling or cutting the  tariff on the imported raw materials for the U.S. manufacturing companies to strengthen  the manufacturing competitiveness. Also, the government increased fiscal  expenditure on transportation infrastructure construction and energy and  improvement of the supply chains. It also focused on encouraging development of  21st century strategic emerging industries. The related measures include tax  cuts and fiscal spending on promoting the technology innovation of domestic  enterprises and stimulate the famous worldwide multinational companies back to  the United States. In addition, many government agencies, market places and  partnership such as Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office (AMNPO), the  National Innovation Marketplace (NIM) and the Hollings Manufacturing Extension  Partnership (MEP) have been established to improve the coordination of  manufacturing policy across the federal government.<br>
    The coordinated  development of agriculture and services is also considered crucial to the  balanced growth of U.S. The importance of the production of high quality and  standards and improvement of the global supply chain of agricultural products was  clearly stated in the President&rsquo;s 2013 Trade Policy Agenda. And, as tourism has  become the most potential service industry, the U.S. government began to  implement the &quot;National Tourism Strategy&quot; in 2011 with the goal of attracting  100 million visitors every year to the U.S. by 2021. <br>
    (4) Advancing Innovation and New Deal of Green Growth<br>
    The Obama&rsquo;s administration, the National  Economic Council and the Office for Information Technology Policy issued &ldquo;A  Strategy For American Innovation&rdquo; jointly on September 21, 2009 to clarify for  the development of the clean energy technologies and industries as the core of high-speed  to sustain economic growth of U.S.. Under the guidance of the innovation  strategy, many measures have been taken: a) The investment on clean energy was  intensified. The ARRA2009 stipulates that the government will spend $150  billion on the R&amp;D of new energy. In fact, the data from the US Department  of Energy shows that $600 billion has been put into the shale gas exploration  and production. b)  The U.S. government advanced the standards of clean energy and accelerated the  transformation of technical achievements into the production. Currently there  are more than 25 incentive policies ongoing. c) The <em>American</em> <em>Clean</em> <em>Energy</em> <em>and</em> <em>Security</em> <em>Act</em> of 2009 (ACES) has renewed  the renewable energy development framework of legislation. The government set  up a &quot;Clean Technology Fund（CTF）&quot; to promote clean utilization of traditional fossil energy. It also advanced a  series of measures such as reform and enforcement of intellectual property  rights, wireless plan, patent reform agenda, and promote the K-12 education,  and so on, to accelerate innovation growth.<br>
    In the meantime, with the United States  being a global power of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the Obama  administration proposed the &quot;Green New Deal&quot; to fight against the  climate change. The President&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan was released on June 25,  2013，aiming at cutting carbon emissions through sustained and responsible  action on climate change. It&rsquo;s stated that the President remains firmly  committed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 percent  below 2005 levels by 2020, and will reduce carbon pollution by at least 3  billion metric tons cumulatively by 2030.  Externally, The U.S. has made the leading efforts in the international climate  negotiations during the past five years, including the actions in the  Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) and APEC negotiation of which the agreement of environmental products  has gotten a breakthrough in 2012, agreeing that the tariffs on the 24  environment related products should be reduced to 5% or even lower in 2015.</p>
  <h1>The Assessment of the strategic  effects</h1>
  <h2>Stable Macro-economic Recovery </h2>
  <p>    After the implementation of the new  strategy, the U.S. economy keeps growing in a moderate rate 2.25% since 2009 (<em>See Figure 2</em>).  The Peterson Institute forecasts this rate would accelerate to 2.9%  and 3.2% in 2014 and 2015. Personal Income increased steadily by 13.1% in  last 5 years, while both of the DPI and the PCE has increased by 0.15% since  April 2013. The market is also under the recovery, after hitting the bottom in 2012, the U.S.  housing market kept growing on both quantity and price in 2013 to the highest  level since November 2009. The Consumer Confidence  Index has improved significantly to pre-crisis levels, reaching 78.1. Employment  conditions continued to be better (<em>See Figure 3</em>). It is predicted  by Peterson  Institute that the unemployment rate would fall to 6.7% and 6.2% in 2014 and  2015.  <br>

  <h2>Improved Fiscal Deficit and  imbalance of trade </h2>
  <p>With the &quot;two-way fiscal adjusting measures&rdquo;,  the share of federal deficit in GDP reduced from 10.1% in 2009 to 7% i2012(<em>See Figure 4</em>). According to the U.S. Treasury  Department in August 2013, the budget deficit is projected to  decline to 4.5 % of GDP in fiscal year 2014, to dip below 3% of GDP by fiscal  year 2017, and realize balance in 2019, with the national debt-to-GDP ratio  falling to 73% in 2023.<br>

    <li>As to the trade deficit, (<em>See Figure 5</em>), total trade deficit and goods  trade deficit was getting better in last 4 years, while the service trade kept  increasing surpluses. If we calculate the means of deficit of 2 phase: 2003~2009  and 2010~2013, the results illustrates that after the implementation of NEI,  the mean of aggregate deficit in phase 2 decreased 20.3% to 515.6 billion  dollars from the previous phase. However, it mainly came from the 107% increase  of service trade surplus mean, rather than the 0.6% decrease of goods trade  deficit mean.</li>

  <h2>Expansion of Exports and Related Jobs</h2>
  <p>    NEI measures have remarkable  effects on America's export and employment growth. The data from ITA shows that exports  of goods and services has increase in 44% from 2009 to 2013, with the goods  trade growing 48.7% and service trade growing 30.1%(<em> See Figure 6</em>).<br>

  <p>    The liberalization of  trade and investment is crucial to the U.S. export. The American exports to the  FTA countries accounted for 46.3% of its total exports in 2013. Especially the  markets of Columbia,  Panama and South Korea expanded very fast under the FTAs between U.S. and those  3 countries which were forced into effect in 2012. Last year, the American  exports to Columbia rose by 13.7% and it has become the second largest importer  of American agricultural products in South America. The exports of  transportation equipment to South Korea increased 24%. Even the multilateral  trade negotiations of TPP is still on going, but the goods exports to the 12  members has reached $6.98 trillion, as 43.9% of its total  exports. <br>
    With the export expansion, jobs were increasingly  created by both goods and service trade(<em>See Figure 7</em>). The job support from goods trade is much stronger than the serve  trade. Meanwhile, data also shows every export-related job contributed more and  more value, which mean the productivity and export price were both growing.<br>

  <h2>Revitalization of U.S. Substantive Economy </h2>
  <p>     The U.S. manufacturing industry was gradually  growing. The. U.S. Department of Commerce, in 2012, indicates that the U.S. manufacturing  industry had consecutive growth for 31 months—best in the past 25 years. Meanwhile,  the knowledge-intensive industry which directly resulted in 34.8% of GDP created  27.1 million jobs. Data from U.S. Institute for Supply Management（ISM）indicates that  since September 2009 most of the PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) was above  50%, and the Diffusion Index was above 42.8%, showing the positive activities  of businesses and economy.  The Manufacturers Alliance（MAPI）predicted that the annual rate of the manufacturing production will  be up to 2.2%, 3.2% and 4.1% in  2013-2015 respectively.<br>
    The International Market  Share and the Trade Competitiveness Index (TC)  are the commonly used indicators of measuring the international  competitiveness. Data from WTO International Trade Statistics Database shows  that, in 2012 the U.S. is still the largest service trade country and second  largest goods trade country in the world. It occupied 10.4% of the world  agricultural products market. The export of major manufacturing categories,  such as chemicals, food, office equipment, telecommunications equipment and  automation, ranked third, although the fuel and related products exports share  only reached 4% of the world market, but the export value has risen by 68% from  2011. The export share of service sectors, such as transportation, tourism,  communications, telecommunications, insurance, financial and franchising  remained the highest.<br>

  <p>Note：*including  advertising, accounting, engineering, law, medical care and so on. TC=(Xi-Mi)/  (Xi+Mi)， Xi and Mi means the value of exports and imports in a period(generally  1 year)，ranging from-1 to 1. TC&gt;0 means it is competitive, the closer to 1，the stronger  competitive it is. TC&lt;0 means it is not competitive,  the closer to -1, the stronger  disadvantageous it is . <br>
    Data source:  Calculated by the HS statistics（98 categories）in the UN Monthly  COMTRADE, only listing main representative products  with strong competitiveness.<br>
    Table 1 shows the TC of the main export  products and services in 2012. It illustrates that U.S. is still in the leading  position of the world with strong competitiveness especially in the advanced  manufacturing and knowledge-intensive sectors. The Wilson Center reported in  March 2013 also indicates that the United States has obvious advantage in many  areas such as aerospace, medical, synthetic biology, advanced materials and  rapid prototyping manufacturing, etc. So it is possible that the new wave of  innovation on the advanced manufacturing areas, including the technology of  complete coverage of the wireless network, and wide use of cloud computing will  appear in the United States in the near future.</p>
  <h2>Achievement on Energy Independency and Green Growth </h2>
  <p>    The technology  breakthrough of the shale gas has greatly improved the domestic supply of crude  oil in the United States. Current data from Energy Information Administration（EIA）shows that the domestic crude oil output has increased by 40% since 2008. The  American oil production has reached as much as 7.3 million barrels a day in May  2013, which is the first time for exceeding its imports of 7.26 million  barrels, and will increase to 13.2 million barrels per day in 2014. The United  States may surpass Russia, becoming the largest oil producer in OPEC countries.  Furthermore, America's energy exports increased by 6% in 2012 which has become  one of the most powerful export products to cut the huge U.S. trade deficit. <br>
    The demand for crude oil fell further in the United States, partly due  to the pressure of new fuel efficiency standards  released by Obama administration and the cheaper price of gas. The U.S. crude  oil imports dropped by 15.1% in June 2013 and reduced 1.37 million barrels per  day comparing to the same period last year, and became less dependent on oil  imports from Middle East. EIA also predicted that America's oil imports from  the Middle East would fall from 1.9 million barrels a day in 2011 to 0.1  million barrels by 2035. <br>
    The energy efficiency has  also been improved. Over the past five years, the average miles per gallon of a  new car and light truck have increased by 19%. And the laboratory average  nominal per gallon of fuel mileage will increase from 27.6 in 2011 miles to  54.5 miles by 2025. <br>
    With the measures of Green Growth  Strategy, the &quot;Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks&quot;  released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in April 2013 shows that  in 2011, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions totaled 6,702 million metric tons CO2,  and the U.S. emissions decreased by 1.6% from 2010 to 2011.Furthermore the  greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 were 6.9% below 2005 levels . <br>
    It is clear that the United States is approaching  energy independence through innovation of clean energy technologies as the core  of Green Growth Strategy, and gradually achieving strategic transformation and  sustainable development.</p>
  <h1> Challenges</h1>
  <p>After five year-implement of the U.S.  growth strategy, from the analysis above, we can come to the conclusion that  the policies and measures have played positive roles in the recovery of U.S.  economy. However, for the long-term goal of &ldquo;strong, sustainable and balanced  economy&rdquo;, there are still some big challenges the U.S. government should face: </p>
  <h2>Re-balance challenges </h2>
  <p>    To the internal fiscal  imbalance, the fiscal cliff problem has not been fundamentally solved. Since  the Obama Administration insisted on health-care reform, the government hit the  debt ceiling time and time again. In June 2013, the federal debt was over $16.7  trillion, accounting for 73% of GDP.<br>
    To the external imbalance, U.S. is still  in a severe situation. In 2013, while the service trade surplus increased  53.6%, the deficit of goods trade even deteriorated 8.1%  from 2010 , Thus, the U.S government should put more efforts to turn the tide. </p>
  <h2>Export-expansion challenges </h2>
  <p>NEI aims at doubling the U.S. export to  $3.14 trillion. But the growth rate of the U.S. export was slower and slower in  last 4 years, from 16.8% down to 2.8%. Only the export increase 37.2%, the  target of NEI can be realized. Obviously, it is impossible. <br>
    With the liberalization arrangement of  trade and investment, American companies export goods and services to over 70  countries and districts. But as the traditional market, NAFTA and EU were still  the main partners, accounting for nearly 50% of the total U.S. exports in 2013.  This share is even over 70% with the TPP partners. At the same time, the export  share to China, Japan , South Korea and Singapore was only 7.7%, 4.1%, 2.6% and  1.9%. It means strategic effect on exploring new market in Asia is not strong  enough. What&rsquo;s more, many transition countries, such as China and Russia, are  running into the structural reforming stage so that they will gradually slow  the GDP growth. It will put pressure on the continuous and fast expansion of U.S. exports.</p>
  <h2>Economic-transformation  challenges </h2>
  <h3>    Table 2 shows the importance of Personal  Consumption Expenditure (PCE) and Export in GDP growth. The contribution rates  indicate that PCE played a much stronger role in U.S. economy development than  export. The contribution of the export, especially the contribution of the  goods export fell sharply in the last 4 years. What&rsquo;s more, the share of PCE to  GDP dropped a little from 70% in 2011 to 68.4% and the share of export to GDP  stayed on 13.5% in the last 3years. That&rsquo;s to say, PCE is still the absolute  main motion of GDP. As the macro-economy gradually recovers, the increasing personal  income will stimulate the stronger consuming demand so that it is more  difficult to get success in the transformation of the economic growth mode.</h3>

  <h1>Implications and Recommendations to China</h1>
  <p>As the  second-largest economy in the world, China now is also facing the issues of  sustainable and balanced economic growth, such as the transforming the economic  growth mode, balancing international accounts, obtaining sustainable  development, and so on. As to the positive effects of the U.S. sustainable and  balanced growth strategy, China can get some enlightenments.</p>
  <h2>Enhance the pull function of consumption in China&rsquo;s economy </h2>
  <p>Investment, consumption and foreign trade are the essential parts of  economy growth. Any country shouldn&rsquo;t excessively rely on any certain one. The  U.S. economy growth mode, which has been relying too much on consumption, is  imbalanced and unsustainable, so the U.S. government reformed to enhance the  pull function of investment and export. On the contrary, as &quot;the  troika&quot; of China&rsquo;s economy, the contribution rate of foreign trade is much  higher than others. The dependence degree of China's import and export trade still  reached 50.4% in the first half of the year 2013.  This trade-driven mode is not balanced and sustainable either, which has caused  plenty of external risks and constraints to the long-term development. As to  the investment, 4 trillion RMB stimulus investment of government created the  miracle of growth in times of crisis, but many aggravating problems have also  arisen, such as the real estate price bubble, the local debt, overcapacity,  etc. Meanwhile power  of consumption is insufficient. From1978 to 2011,  Chinese real residents' consumption per capita rose from $168 to $1911  (2011price), but its share of GDP decreased from 48.4% to 34.4%, which was less  than 1/20 of that of the U.S..  Therefore, China must strengthen the pull effects of consumption, accelerating  the transformation from &quot;exports &amp; investment-driven economy&quot; to  &quot;consumption-driven economy&quot;.<br>
    Firstly, China  should put the improvement of the residents' income and distribution institute  as the first priority. Data shows that, China's real GDP per capita in 2012 was  $6,012, less than 1/8 of America's, which was $49,880.  The low level of income and inequality of income distribution fundamentally  have restricted the expansion of consumption and private investment demand in  China. Secondly, China needs to create a better consuming environment by  implementing a series of measures such as improving the market regulation  system to protect the rights of consumers, strengthening the infrastructure  construction on transportation, communication, vigorously developing e-commerce  to explore more consuming channels, and so on. Thirdly, China must keep  reforming the medical treatment and social security to relieve the worries of  the residents' consumption. Additionally, China needs to further develop the  rural consumption market. </p>
  <h2>Promote the Innovation-driven Growth of China's Strategic  Industry </h2>
  <p>    Strategic emerging industries will be the  engine of the sustained economic development in the 21st century. The  competition in this field will also be the core of international competition in  the future. So, the U.S. reviving strategy of &quot;Made in U.S.&quot; which is  very prospective, focuses on developing the &quot;innovation-driven strategic  industry&quot; to occupy  commanding elevation of the world competition. <br>
    For China, the government has attached  great importance to developing the strategic emerging industries too. The  &quot;National Strategic Emerging Industry Developing Plan in the 12th  Five-year Period&quot; issued by the State Council in July 2012 identified seven  strategic emerging industries, including the new generation of information  technology, biology, high-end equipment manufacturing, and so on. It also  clarified the 24 key directions and 20 major projects. China has obtained many  achievements since 2012. The investment and output of strategic emerging  industries in many provinces kept growing with over 20% growth, even  significantly higher than average growth rate of the manufacturing industry. They  play the increasingly strong leading role in industry upgrading. <br>
    However, many problems such as lacking of  independent intellectual property rights and core technology, redundant  construction of the low-end industrial chain, lack of brand products, and so  on, still very seriously affect the development of the strategic industries in  China. Photovoltaic (PV) industry and LED industry are always facing the  protectionism from European and American countries. Therefore, China&rsquo;s strategic  emerging industries must be driven by &quot;innovation&quot;, which is also the  only solution of its long term development.  <br>
    First of all, the government should coordinate  the investment on the strategic emerging industries to avoid redundant  construction. Second, the government must continue in intensifying national  policy support, improve the financing channels for small and medium-sized  enterprises who should be regarded as the main body of technological innovation,  and help them speed up the transformation of innovation achievements. Third,  China should increase spending on R&amp;D, emphasize on the combination of  &quot;education, research and production&quot;, and improve the protection  system of the intellectual property rights (IPR) to protect the innovation of  enterprises. Fourth, enterprises need to consider innovation as the basis of  core competitive ability and put more efforts on innovation and the ownership  of independent IPR. They should establish more competitive brands and protect  the IPR actively. Additionally, some powerful enterprises can explore the  international market by FDI (foreign direct investment) which would be helpful  to circumvent trade barriers<strong>.</strong></p>
  <h2>Promote Structural Balanced  Trade Growth of China </h2>
  <p>    External balance is crucial  to any sustainable economy, not only U.S., but also China. Due to the open  polices since 1978, increasing foreign trade and FDI made both of the current  account and capital account of China surplus for many years. Although China&rsquo;s  international payments gradually tended to be overall balanced since 2009, the  capital account became deficit for the first time in 2012, while the foreign  trade surplus is still as high as $213.8 billion at the same time, which keeps  China facing the high pressure on RMB appreciation and constant trade friction  with many partners. <br>
    Different to U.S. overall trade deficit,  China&rsquo;s external imbalance lies in the imbalanced structure of foreign trade:  (a) imbalance between trade of goods and service. Data shows that the goods  trade surplus valued at $231 billion is much higher than service trade deficit  peaked at $89.6 billion in 2012, in which transportation, tourism, insurance,  proprietary technology are the primary deficit industries. (b) the imbalance  between import and export of goods (as the surplus data shows), which is caused  by two main reasons: one is that the FDI enterprises from Europe, the U.S. and  east Asian economies transferred the labor-intensive process of manufacturing  to China so that it looks like China has exported large of high-tech products.  For example, 40% of the total imports of the U.S. in 2012 were from China, most  of which were the iPhones processed in China.  Another reason is that the traditional calculation method of trade exaggerated  the scale of China's trade surplus.<br>
    Therefore, to achieve the structural balanced  growth of trade is the main target for China. It is important that China pay  more attention to enhancing the export quality, improving the terms of trade,  accelerating industrial upgrading, developing strategic emerging industries to  stimulate exports, improving the position in the international industrial  chain, as well as increasing the import of high-tech products. Second, China  industries need to put more emphasis towards strengthening the research on and  actively use the more scientific methods to measure and reflect the status of  the trade imbalance. Third, China would be wise to learn from the United States  and other developed countries that vigorously develop modern service industry,  intensify the service industry structure adjustment, and promote high  value-added services such as information, insurance, financial and consulting,  which are far behind the developed countries. Fourth, the Chinese government  should accelerate the integration negotiations and provide strong support for  the competitive enterprises to invest abroad.</p>
  <h2>Enhance the &quot;Energy Strategy&quot;  for the Green Growth of China </h2>
  <p>    China's rapid growth is  based on the &quot;3 High &amp; 1 Low mode&quot; (high input, high consumption,  high pollution and low benefit). This has brought a lot of problems. First, the  dependence on oil imports makes China more vulnerable to the price fluctuations  and supply risk. The U.S. energy information administration (EIA) announced in  October 2013 that China has become the world's largest net importer of oil and  the dependence degree has increased to 57%. According to forecast of Wood Mackenzie, China will spend $500 billion a year on importing oil after 2020,  which is even more than America&rsquo;s peak spending on oil imports of $335 billion. Second, the EU and the United States are constantly increasing the  environmental standards, which make it more difficult for Chinese enterprises  to expand market in the developed countries.  Third, China has become as large in energy consumption and emission power as the  U.S.. The serious environmental pollution has threatened the survival of  Chinese. As  President Obama said in the President&rsquo;s Climate Action  Plan, environmental  protection should be equally important as the economic growth. Facing the  various problems, it is urgent for China to thoroughly change  the &quot;3 High &amp; 1 Low growth Mode&quot;. <br>
    The U.S. energy strategy  and measures such as providing policy support, developing new clean energy  standard and establishing Clean Technology Fund and so on have some reference  value to China. China should enhance &quot;energy strategy&quot; to achieve  energy independence and green growth. <br>
    First of all,  the technical innovation is only solution for China to catch up with the developed  countries on development of new energies and utilization of traditional  energies. So Chinese government should expand the R&amp;D spending, encourage  more and more participation from businesses, and emphasize the role of mid-west  area of China in accelerating development of energy industry. Second, the  Chinese government must constantly revise domestic standards according to the  change of international standards, and accelerate the enterprises evolution in  the free market rather than administrative internals. Third, the current  Chinese resident consumption mode is changing from necessity-oriented  consumption to development-oriented consumption so that the carbon emissions of  household energy consumption are increasing year by year. So Advocating of  &quot;low-carbon life style&quot; is very important for China. Fourth,  accelerate the construction of emission permits trade of carbon, and promote  the energy cooperation all over the world.</p>
  <h2>Deepen the International Economic  Cooperation in the East-Asia </h2>
  <p>    East-Asia is the most  dynamic and potential region in the world, the importance of which has been  testified by the &quot;Return to the Asia-Pacific Strategy&quot; of U.S. China.  And it is very important to China too. Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics  of China, in 2012, five out of top ten trade partners of China are east-Asian  countries and districts (ASEAN, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan),  accounting for 37.6% of the total amount of China's foreign trade. Especially,  the cooperation between China and ASEAN is developing very rapidly. Total trade  value between China and ASEAN increased 10.2% from 2011 and reached $400.09  billion in 2012, accounting for 10.35% of China's foreign trade. ASEAN has  become the third largest trade partner of China's for four consecutive years.  Furthermore, the &ldquo;10+3 Cooperation Mechanism&rdquo; among ASEAN and China, Japan and  South Korea, which was established in 1997 to cope with the financial crisis  jointly, has built a relatively complete platform in East-Asia. The cooperation  process has established 17 ministerial meeting mechanisms and 24 pragmatic  cooperation, built a regional foreign exchange reserve of $240 billion and  nearly 800,000 tons of rice emergency reserve which play very crucial roles in  the cooperation in east-Asian area.<br>
    As the largest Asian  country, the cooperation with east-Asian countries should play the pivot role  in China&rsquo;s international cooperation. China should continue to promote the  monetary cooperation with the east-Asian countries and jointly resist the obvious  spillover effect of &quot;Quantitative Easing Policy&quot; of developed  countries on the interest rate and exchange rate, while expanding the amount of  currency swap and accelerate the internationalization of the RMB. Furthermore,  China should also strengthen the mutual trust with ASEAN under the  &quot;China-ASEAN 2+7 Cooperation Framework&quot;<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""> </a>,  promote RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) negotiation, push  the liberalization of trade and investment, and enhance the comprehensive  cooperation on politic, economy, security, humanities, science and t  technology. <br>
    At the same time, the  China-US economic relationship is one of the most important bilateral  relationships in the world. Although there are many differences between China  and the U.S. on economic development, the American sustainable and balanced  growth strategy also have created many mutual benefits for both sides. For  example, the &quot;NEI of U.S.&quot; and &quot;Five-year Plan of China&quot;  have formed a complementary opportunity for the expansion of U.S. exports and  increase of China imports, which is helpful to the external balanced growth for  the two countries. Meanwhile the liberalization of trade and service promoted  by U.S. through FTA will also give China chance to achieve the industrial  upgrading and transforming benefits from the cooperation with the U.S. companies  on tourism, education and financial services to achieve balance for both. The  American technology breakthrough on clean energy and related fields can help  China to achieve &quot;Green Growth&quot; as well. <br>
    Therefore, it is important  for both China and U.S. government to keep the China-US strategic and economic  dialogue mechanism on-going, and develop a comprehensive and mutually  beneficial economic partnership based on mutual respect. </p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>    Balanced and sustainable  growth is an increasing concern in the world today. As the largest and second  largest economies, both of the U.S. and China should take the responsibility to  promote the fast, healthy and sustainable development of the world economy. The  U.S. growth strategy, with comprehensive policies and measures, has accelerated  America&rsquo;s recovery, relieved the internal and external imbalance, expanding exports,  revitalizing the substantive economy and promoting the sustainable economy  development. Although the U.S. government is still facing the challenges of  reducing the fiscal deficit and trade deficit, realizing of NEI target and continuous  export expansion and transforming the economy growth model, the overall effect  of the Obama Administration&rsquo;s growth strategy is very positive.<br>
    Meanwhile, many policies and measures  under the U.S. growth strategy have implications for China. To realize the &ldquo;balanced  and sustainable growth&rdquo;, China should speed up the overall transformation,  strengthen the innovation, rebalance the trade growth and intensify  international cooperation.</p>

    <p>For example, in 2010 the United States issued  &quot;double reverse surveys&rdquo; frequently towards China&rsquo;s strategic emerging  industries such as PV and application level wind tower which China is  competitive. The U.S. also launched &quot;337 investigation&quot; on electronic  products, machinery manufacturing and other high-tech products. Meanwhile, the  U.S. also increased the difficulty of mergers and acquisitions for foreign  enterprises to enter the U.S. market on grounds of &quot;national  security&quot; constantly which also limits the overseas expansion of Chinese  science and technology enterprises.<br>
