Paper Title : <br>Relationship between Leisure Boredom and Quality of Life: A Case Study of Undergraduates in Southern Taiwan</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between leisure boredom and quality of life for undergraduates in Taiwan. The researchers adopted the survey method. The scales of “leisure boredom (LB)” and “quality of life (QOL)” were used. A total of 403 undergraduate students from a university in southern Taiwan participated in the study. Descriptive statistics and Pearson’s product-moment correlation in SPSS 14.0 for Windows were employed to examine the collected data. According to the results, negative relationships were observed among leisure boredom and four dimensions of quality of life. Four dimensions of quality of life were revealed to be significantly related to leisure boredom, with the physical (r= -.39), psychological (r= -.48), social (r= -.52) and environmental (r= -.33) aspects being negatively related (p&lt;0.01). Finally, suggestions for future researchers are provided to make further contributions to the field.</p>

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <h2>Leisure participation of Taiwanese  undergraduates </h2>
  <p>Participating  in leisure activities has been found to be beneficial to people. According to  Driver, Brown and Peterson (1991), benefits extended  from leisure can cover numerous aspects of people&rsquo;s lives, such as their physical  health, and their psychological, social and economic well-being. Meanwhile,  leisure is also regarded as an important way for people to maintain and even  improve their own health, to reduce the negative influence of stress on  physical and mental situation, to help people cope with stress. However, when  people have no plans for how to utilize their leisure time, or do not have the  ability to fill their leisure time meaningfully, they may fail to receive  benefits from their leisure time, which results in leisure boredom. Leisure  boredom can cause serious problems. For example, researchers (Ganley, 1989;  Ian, Shane, &amp; Roberta, 2000; Lin, Lin, &amp; Wu, 2009; Newberry &amp;  Duncan, 2001; McIntosh, MacDonald, &amp; McKeganey, 2008) have indicated that  various social issues and some forms of delinquency, such as Internet or  alcohol addiction and drug abuse, could derive from leisure boredom. <br>
    The subject  of this study is Taiwanese college students. Given that college students are assumed  to be a group with rather more free time than other groups in  Taiwan. Moreover, comparing to students of other ages, college students are  old enough to decide how to use their spare time (Wang, Kao, Huan  &amp; Wu, 2011). Nevertheless, is do not mean that all the college students  know how to manage their free time adequately when transferring from a  structured senior high school environment to an unstructured college  environment. Shaikh and Deschamp (2006) found that most students reported that they  did not maintain good health due to bad management of using their time to do  things for improving their health or spend any time on exercise or other  healthy activities. Another study by Mokhtari, Reichard, and Gardner (2009) reported  that most of the time when college students are free is actually associated  with screens, including either browsing the Internet or watching television. It  was revealed that the amount of time college students spending on  computer use and television watching were negatively correlated with exercise  and physical activity (Buckworth &amp; Nigg, 2004), and could result in  unhealthy lifestyles, including Internet addiction or being excessively  sedentary.<br>
    Although  leisure boredom may cause some passivity and health problems in one&rsquo;s life, few  previous studies have focused on the negative influences of leisure boredom on  quality of life. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between  leisure boredom and quality of life for undergraduates to clarify whether  leisure boredom negatively affects any aspects of life quality.</p>
  <h2>Leisure boredom </h2>
  <p>According to Iso-Ahola  and Weissinger, (1990) leisure boredom could be defined as,  &quot;A negative mood or state of mind that reflects a mismatch between optimal  experiences that are perceptually available to an individual&quot; (p. 4). People may  experience the feeling of leisure boredom because what they do in  leisure time is just for time-killing, namely, meaningless. Leisure boredom sometimes  may also be created by multiple constraints. It is  more likely to be experienced by people who cannot manage their leisure time or  who are unaware of the psychological rewards of leisure (Iso-Ahola &amp;  Weissinger, 1990). Numerous young students who do not know how to use their  leisure time effectively or who experience leisure boredom tend to use alcohol  or smoking to alleviate boredom rather than participating in positive leisure  activities. Therefore, leisure boredom emerges as an important issue,  particularly for college students. To measure leisure boredom, the most widely utilized  measurement tool is the Leisure Boredom Scale (or called LBS) from Iso-Ahola  and Weissinger (1987). The two scholars (1990) then also re-examined the scale on  three studies of U.S. college students to investigate the concept of leisure  boredom, and a high internal consistency was found based on the  study.</p>
  <h2>Quality of life </h2>
  <p>We can trace the concept of &quot;quality  of life&quot; back to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle&rsquo;s belief. Aristotle  interpreted quality of life with the concept of happiness which he described  the state where everything was going smoothly and the soul was satisfied. Since  &ldquo;life&rdquo; is what we all lead, pursue and are concerned about, numerous studies  have examined the concept of &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo;. Generally, quality of life is regarded as a multi-polar and  comprehensive concept because it includes multiple aspects. Among them, health-related  quality of life has gained attention in recent years, but according to Fayers  and Machin (2000), even this concept is defined only loosely. There is general  agreement that the relevant quality of life could be concluded into general  health, physical and emotional functions, as well as social interactions,  psychological dimension, life satisfaction, and so on, since aspects may vary  from different point of view. Because of the diverse definition and measurement  of the concept of &ldquo;Quality of life&rdquo;, the World Health Organization has designed  a scale to measure the concept. The scale is based on the idea of &ldquo; ​​the cultural  context and value system in which they live, and in relation to their goals,  expectations, standards, and concerns. Quality of life is a complex and  broad-ranging concept, incorporating physical health, psychological state,  level of independence, social relations, personal beliefs, and relationship to  salient features of the environment.&quot; (Szabo, 1996; the WHOQOL Group, 1994, 1995, 1998a,  1998b). According to this definition, the quality of life of individuals is stressed from a multi-dimensional view. </p>
  <h2>Relationship  between leisure boredom and quality of life </h2>
  <p>According to Robinson and Godbey (1999), free time could represent the eagerness for people to achieve their best  chance of happiness and the pursuit of happiness and self-expression. They thus  perceived leisure participation as an effective way to create meaning and  promote quality of life. Iwasaki (2006) suggested that leisure experience could  provide a source of positive emotions and well-being, positive identity and  self-esteem, as well as social and cultural connections, and moreover could  improve quality of life. Han and Ian (2007) also indicated that leisure  participation generates pleasant mood states and contributes to quality of  life. <br>
    Nevertheless, leisure time might not always positively influence an  individual. The delivery of the above benefits of leisure to an individual  cannot be guaranteed, particularly when leisure boredom appears. The negative  influence of leisure boredom on the lives of individuals is even worse. Some  deviant behaviors can result from the presence of leisure boredom. For example,  Gabriel (1988) observed that if boredom becomes a constraint or problem during the  establishing periods of leisure behaviour, individuals may appear with various  deviant or negative behaviours as a relief. Another example is from Ian et al.  (2000), who suggested that many young people who report high levels of boredom  also tend to exhibit high levels of alcohol and drug abuse. McIntosh et al.  (2008) also found that boredom was one motivator of teenage alcohol use. Furthermore,  Iso-Ahola and Weissinger (1990) reported the negative linkage between leisure  boredom and physical and mental health. Weissinger (1995) postulated that college-aged  students who feel more bored in their leisure time reported that they were less  mentally and physically healthy than those who reported lower levels of boredom.  On the other hand, Coleman and Iso-Ahola (1993) found that social support and  self-determination disposition generated and created from leisure could be a  healthy buffer against stress. When leisure boredom occurs, it might reduce  opportunities for involvement in leisure activities with friends or family, and  may then reduce social interaction or social support from others. Pierceall and  Keim (2007) also suggested that it is important for college students to cope  with stress from their academic work and daily routine through leisure  activities that include talking to family or gathering with friends, and  exercising.</p>
  <h1>METHOD </h1>
  <h2>Sampling </h2>
  <p>The initial sample comprised 500 undergraduates from one southern  university in Taiwan. We selected these students purposively from ten courses  with enrollments of more than 80 students from different department to  represent the variety of of the sample. Questionnaires were administered  anonymously in the classroom. Finally, we collected 403 valid questionnaires overall,  which appears as an 81% response rate.</p>
  <h2> Instrument</h2>
  <h3>Measures of Leisure Boredom</h3>
  <p>The translated and modified Chinese Leisure Boredom Scale (LBS) (Chung, 2002,  originally from Iso-Ahola &amp; Weissinger, 1987, 1990) was used to measure  individual differences in perceptions of boredom during leisure time (Iso-Ahola  &amp; Crowley, 1991). The LBS comprises 16 items to which subjects responded on  a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The sample  items included: &quot;For me, leisure time just drags on and on,&quot;  &quot;Leisure time is boring,&quot; &quot;Leisure time activities do not excite  me,&quot; &quot;I do not have many leisure skills,&quot; and &quot;In my  leisure time, I usually don't like what I'm doing, but I don't know what else  to do.&quot; Among the 16 items, 10 were reverse coding (Wang, Wu, Wu, &amp;  Huan, 2012). The overall Cronbach's alpha for leisure boredom was .86 (TABLE 1).</p>

  <h3>Measures  of Quality of Life </h3>
  <p>We  adapted the Quality of Life scale designed by the World Health Organization  (WHOQOL-BREF) as the measurement. WHOQOL-BREF comprises the physical,  psychological, social as well as the environmental four dimensions. Overall,  there are 22 items in this scale. We conducted principle component factor  analysis with varimax rotation in the pre-test. Based on the results of the  analysis, five items were deleted because of low factor loadings (below .30). As  for the reliability test, the coefficients of Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha were all above  0.67, for all the subscales in each construc, and ranged from 0.67 to 0.73 (see  TABLE 2). </p>
  <h2>Analysis </h2>
  <p><em>SPSS14.0 for Windows</em> is used in this study to analyze the data. We  conducted descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis to explore  the relationship between leisure boredom and the four aspects of quality of  life.</p>

  <h1>RESULTS </h1>
  <h2>Respondent profile </h2>
  <p>The 403 respondents  included 228 females (56%) and 175 males (44%). Moreover, the sample comprised  44% freshmen, 12% sophomores, 22% juniors, and 22% seniors. Among all the  respondents, the mean age was 20 years old (SD = 2.72). The average free time  of the respondents on weekdays and weekends was 7 and 13 hours per day,  respectively. Meanwhile, average time spent sleeping was 7 (SD = 1.19) hours a  day. The above measurements were obtained via open-ended questions which are  reported by the responds themselves. The mean score of respondent self-reported  general quality of life was 3.41(SD = 0.73), indicating a fair satisfaction for  quality of life for the respondents.</p><br clear="all">
  <h2>Leisure boredom and quality of life </h2>
  <p>Negative  relationships were observed among leisure boredom and the four dimensions of  quality of life. All dimensions of quality of life were found to be  significantly related to leisure boredom, with the physical (r= -.39,  p&lt;0.01), psychological (r= -.48, p&lt;0.01), social (r= -.52, p&lt;0.05) and  environmental (r= -.33, p&lt;0.05) aspects being negatively related to  leisure boredom. The results indicated that when individuals experience boredom  during their leisure time, they are likely to have worse quality of life (see TABLE  3).</p>

  <h1>CONCLUSION </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This study explores the relationship between leisure  boredom and quality of life among college students. The results revealed that  leisure boredom is negatively and significantly related to all the aspects of  quality of life, namely the physical, psychological, social and environmental dimensions.  As Iso-Ahola and Weissinger (1990) found that leisure boredom was negatively  related to both mental and physical health. Among the four dimensions  comprising quality of life, the psychological and social dimensions are more  closely correlated with leisure boredom. Since leisure-generated social support  is an important source of positive emotions and well-being, social and cultural  connections help people to cope with stress and enhance their quality of life  (Coleman &amp; Iso-Ahola, 1993; Iwasaki, 2006), as the results of this study also  reported. The results indicated that when facing leisure boredom, individuals  are more likely to have fewer opportunities for leisure, less social support  from friends, worse interpersonal relationships and feel more negative and  dissatisfied about life. Meanwhile, when negative situations occur, the results  might be leisure boredom, and vice versa. On the other hand, leisure boredom is  also negatively related to physical and environmental quality of life. The  results suggested that when leisure boredom occurs, individuals may be  dissatisfied with the physical environment, the provision of leisure  opportunities, transportation and information. The results regarding physical  quality of life agree with previous works which mentioned that participating in  leisure activities and exercising helps individuals maintain their physical  health (Weissinger, 1995; Pierceall &amp; Keim, 2007). However, the results of  environmental quality of life differ from the findings of previous studies. While  Lloyd and Friendship (2002) reported that the person-oriented leisure property,  leisure satisfaction, is the best predictor of quality of life and the place-center  for the property does not affect the quality of life, the results showed small between  casual but significant relationship between boredom and environmental quality of  life.  This relationship suggested that although place-centered attributes have  only a minimal influence on quality of life, the opportunities for individuals  to obtain new information and skills, recreation and leisure and improvements  in the quality of their physical environment and even transportation services may  help individuals become more involved in leisure activities and thus avoid leisure  boredom. Based on the research results, it was suggested that a specific  leisure program could be held for college students to help them deal with their  leisure time well. Moreover, leisure and recreation facilities and services  need to be enhanced on campus so that more opportunities for active leisure  patterns could be created.<br>
    Although significant results were found between  leisure boredom and quality of life, certain limitations were also needed to be  stated. First, this study is only based on the samples from a single  university, although it attempted to sample students from different departments  and years. Future studies could use a wider sample. Furthermore, since this  study observed that leisure boredom might motivate some kind of delinquency or  passive leisure activities such as internet addiction or alcohol use, future  studies can further explore the relationships among leisure patterns and  quality of life.</p>
