  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>Job  satisfaction has been found to be a multidimensional construct manifesting the  emotional evaluations of individual regarding their expectations and how well  they have been met. Job satisfaction is commonly  interpreted as the intrinsic sense of accomplishment emerged from performing  tasks while carrying out one&rsquo;s contractual obligations. The term job  satisfaction come into vogue when Hoppock (in 1935) published his classic work  &lsquo;job satisfaction&rsquo;. He defined job satisfaction as &lsquo;any combination of psychological  and environmental circumstances that cause a person truthfully to say, I am  satisfied with my job&rsquo;. Milton Blum (1949) later on has pointed out that job  satisfaction is the result of various attitudes the employees holds towards his  job, towards related factors, and towards life in general. We say that job  satisfaction is an attitude which results from a balancing and summation of  many specific likes and dislikes experienced in connection with the job. In job  satisfaction, four parameters are involved:- <br>
          The person&rsquo;s needs values and character  traits.<br>
          The person&rsquo;s education, training, skill,  experience etc. that determine his contribution to the job.<br>
          Reward the employer gives to him.<br>
          Rewards given to other employees in this  and other similar organization. Different combination of these factors account  for satisfaction-dissatisfaction of employees. <br>
    Management  is responsible for effective utilization of resources. In order for management  to successfully complete this mission, it must be able to utilize the most  important resources human being in a manner that will allow personal  satisfaction while achieving organizational goals. The attainment of the goals  is the best measure of effectiveness and is dependent upon successful  combination of all available resources. One of the means of which these  objectives can be achieved is by providing conducive work culture to the  employees so that they are mentally, physically and emotionally relaxed to  perform their duties and contribute to organizational effectiveness.<br>
    Job  satisfaction is the result of various attitude possessed by an employees  towards his job. These attitudes are related to specific factors such as wages.  Conditions of work, advancement opportunity, prompt settlement of grievances.  Fair treatment by employees and other fringe benefits. Job satisfaction may be  define as an attitude which results from a balancing and summation of many  specific likes and dislikes experienced in connection with the job.</p>
  <h1> Statement Of The Problem </h1>
  <p> Indian organizations are  often criticized for lack of positive job satisfaction. People often compare  the work culture of Indian organization with those found in the west and come  to the conclusion that Indians lacks positive work culture. Often comparisons  are made with the Japanese work culture and again Indian is found wanting  vis-à-vis its Asian counterparts. It is not uncommon to find Indian workers  being accused of high absenteeism, poor discipline, low morale and lack of  interest in work and having little concern for productivity. To the extent that  this criticism is valid, it points towards erosion of work ethic in Indian  organization. At the same time, Indians working abroad, whether as scholars,  scientists, professionals, artisans or even unskilled workers are known to have  done their country proud by exhibiting a level of performance is second to  none. Within Indian too there are organizations, which are well known for  having developed a culture of high performance.<br>
    The  change in the economic policies in the recent past especially after 1991 and  the corresponding linearization of economy have placed competitive challenges  before Indian firms. While opening up new opportunity for corporate expansion  corporate expansion and growth for many firms these changes have also created  patent threats for survival of others. The rapid expansion of industrial  activities required large scale impact of western technology and work farms,  which are also expected to certain western work culture of the protestant ethic  nature. The work values however are not internalized by the Indians to the  extent expected. <br>
    In  this study &lsquo;job&rsquo; means the total relationship between the individual employees  and his employer (organization) and with work for which he gets compensated.  The term &lsquo;satisfaction&rsquo; refers to the simple feeling/ state accompanying the  attainment by an impulse of his/her objectives. The term &lsquo;job satisfaction&rsquo;  therefore refers to the favorableness with which employees view their work and  the term &lsquo;job dissatisfaction &lsquo;to the unfavourableness which they take their  work.<br>
    Job  satisfaction is the result of various attitude possessed by an employee towards  his job. These attitudes are related to specific factors such as wages,  conditions of work, advancement opportunity, prompt settlement of grievances,  fair treatment by employer and other fringe benefits. Job satisfaction may be  defined as an attitude which results from a balancing and summation of many  specific likes and dislikes experienced in connection with the job. <br>
    The last three decades, the problem of job  satisfaction has attracted considerable attention of industrial psychologists.  It is regarded as a very significant factor in workers morale, absenteeism,  accidents, and turnover to some extent productivity, though its relationship  with productivity is not very clear.<br>
    Morse  (1952) suggested that an organization can be evaluated in terms of human  satisfaction&rdquo; the importance of job satisfaction is not only for its possible  association with productivity, absenteeism, turnover and accidents. It s  generally agreed that the dissatisfaction in job is due to poor mental health  which will give rise to anxiety, depression, hyperacidity, headache and  frustration. Since workers spend most of his time on the job, he does not get  job satisfaction. Thus the dissatisfaction of jobs may cause social problems.<br>
    Luthans  (1992) defined job satisfaction as a result of the employee&rsquo;s expectation of  how well their job provides those things which are viewed as important.  Employee&rsquo;s satisfaction from their jobs is highly significant for the effective  functioning of any organization. It plays a key role in influencing the  attendance of workers, their productivity, work motivation, moral and the  overall industrial relations (Scarpello and Campbell, 1983: Srivastava and Roy,  1996, Rajgopal, 1965, Nwestorm and Davis, 1998, vroom, 1964) thus, the  understanding of the job satisfaction level of the workers is essential in  order to motivate them for better productivity.</p>
  <h2>  Objective of the study</h2>
  <p>   To see whether the job satisfaction, propensity to quit the job  and job stress differ according to types of organization and levels of  employees/workers.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>   To examine inter  correlation among job satisfaction and other variable (such as age, experience,  education, income, job stress and performance)</li>
    <li>   To identify the major  causes of job dissatisfaction as perceived by different categories of  respondents and.</li>
    <li>   To make recommendation to  improve the situation for making pragmatic policy to improve the satisfaction  level among employees/workers. The impact of job stress on job satisfaction on  of   employees towards FMCG sector in  Uttarakhand.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>B          Hypothisis</h2>
  <p> The scales which will be used to complete this  study is known as LEA (long employee attitude) scale. Developed by Dr. H.C.Ganguli.  Before developing hypotheses for the study all the nine heads of job  satisfaction. Containing 26 items have been divided in the following two parts.              <br>
    A-     Financial such as:<br>
    (1)      Income.<br>
    (2)      Promotional &amp; training opportunities.<br>
    (3)     Welfare activities health, canteen etc.</p>
  <p>B-     Non-financial related to company practices  &amp; policies:<br>
    (1)      Nature of work.<br>
    (2)     Security.<br>
    (3)     Supervisors&rsquo; behavior<br>
    (4)     Union – Management relation.<br>
    (5)     Colleagues/co-workers.<br>
    (6)      Company practices / policies.</p>
  <p>On  the basis of the above two categories the following hypotheses have been  formulated.<br>
    1.  There is a relationship between income, promotional &amp; training  opportunities, Welfare activities and job satisfaction.<br>
    2.  There is a relationship between nature of work, security, supervisor&rsquo;s behavior  and Job satisfaction.</p>
  <p>3  There is no relationship between union-management relation,  colleagues/co-workers Company practices/policies and job satisfaction.</p>
  <h2>  Research design</h2>
  <h2>The proposed research has been  designed as follows: </h2>
  <p>  Area of study:<br>
    uttarakhand comprises of two  divisions Kumaun and Garhwal region. If we talk about state infrastructure  development corporation of uttarakhand ltd (SIDCUL). Has two SIDCULs one is  developed in kumaun region especially in distric of Udham Singh Nagar and  another is developed in Garhwal region specially spread in Haridwar and  Deharadun districts. For the proposed study only one SIDCUL situated in Udham  Singh Nagar of Uttarakhand is taken.<br>
    Udham Singh  Nagar District. The biggest of Uttarakhand state is situated in North of the  state at Tarai area of the state. This district is prosperous in terms of  agriculture and industrial development: earlier governments of Uttar Pradesh  and government of India had emphasized its attention on this district for the  development of agriculture based industries and other industries. <br>
    The industries like century pulp and paper ltd., Pepsi co.  holdings (India) ltd., Mahindra &amp;Mahindra ltd., Shri ram Honda India ltd.  Godfrey Philips India ltd. had established before 2000. The government of newly  formed state of Uttarakhand has formed an SIDCUL (state infrastructure  development corporation of Uttarakhand ltd.) to govern, promote and attract  industrialists in the state. SIDCUL has established industrial park in Pant Nagar-Rudarpur.  About 350 industries are there. Most of the industries has started its  production and are in growing stage. These industries are categories as newly  established industries. <br>
    There are many industries based on FMCG sector running  successfully, earning high profit and contributing in making economy strong.<br>
    These  industries are Nestle India, Bisleri Pvt. ltd, Dabur India, Hindustan Unilever  ltd, in Udham Singh Nagar District except above mentioned industries have a variety of roles  to play. Some of these may lead to high degree of job satisfaction irrespective  of the job stress experienced, for example, degree of independence and  authority, high salary, new challenges etc.  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The  result of the study shows that there is a possibility of negative relationship  between job satisfaction and stress among managers. However it dose not reach  the critical level required for it to be statistically significant. Perhaps the  variables leading to job satisfaction do not involve stress experienced during  the job of a manager. Managers have a varity of roles to play. Some of these  may lead to high degree of job satisfaction irrespective of the job stress  experienced, for example degree of independence and authority, high salary, new  challenges etc. by the same token there might be variables in the job which may  lead to high degree of job stress independent of job satisfaction for example,  long working hours, too many meeting targets, fiscal accuracy, dependence on  others for getting their job done. Unless specific stress factors are invoked,  job satisfaction may not be impacted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Appropriate number of respondent  shall be included keeping in view the objectives of the study.</h4>
  <h4>Developing  questionnaire:</h4>
  <h4>The questionnaire based on LEA  Scale developed by Dr.H.C.Ganguli consisting of all the 26 items related to job  satisfaction would be used. </h4>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3> Data sourse and collection methords :</h3>
  <h4>Both primary data and secondary  data have to be used.</h4>
  <h4>Primary data: would be collected from the selected organization of  Udham Singh Nagar District of uttarakhand through a structured questionnaire  adminisisered for this purpose only. </h4>
  <h4>Secondary data:  data would  be drived from books, periodicals reports, websites and other publications. It  will be evaluated for its suitability and relevance to the proposed study. </h4>
  <h4> Analysis and interpretation of data:</h4>
  <h4> Employee&rsquo;s attitude scale by Dr.H.C.Ganguli:  This is widely used scale measuring job satisfaction of employees/workers. The  scale consist 26 items in relation to job satisfaction. 26 items of the LEA  scale could be replied by checking any one of the five answers: agreed,  undecided,disagreed, strongly agreed, and disagreed. The score alloted for each  items is 1,2,3,4and 5 respectively. One items of the LEA scale has three alternatives  and the scores allotted are 2,3 and 4.Higher the score greater the  satisfaction. The minimum and maximum score of the LEA scale could be 27 and  129 respectively. The reliability and validity is found to be quite high. </h4>
  <h4>Standard Score:</h4>
  <h4> Insert in order to make intergroup  and intragroup comparison of satisfaction scores standard scores are required.  Therefore actual satisfaction scores from the LEA are converted into standard  score with a mean of 50 and SD of 10. Thereafter standard score norms are  developed for placing employees in five categories of goodness ( such as  standard scores of satisfaction 15 and less is put under highly dissatisfaction  group and standard scores of satisfaction 66 and above is put under highly satisfied  group). </h4>
  <h4>Reassign Appropriate statistical  tools and techniques like Dr. H.C. Ganguli&rsquo;s the LEA (Long employees attitude  Scale), Likert&rsquo;s scale would be used. Different factors identified from  different channels will be evaluated with the help of SPSS(Statistical Package  for social science) software. </h4>

    <li>Employees may be sometimes biased in filling the questionnaire.</li>
    <li>It is difficult to personally visit all the companies taken for  study.</li>
    <li>Errors may be due to variability of population.</li>
    <li>Improper coverage and inadequate or incomplete response may lead  to errors.</li>

  </ul>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>This proposed study has focussed on job  satisfaction level of FMCG sector employees under this study we conclude that  all the financial  and non- financial  factors  directly or indirectily effect  the performance of employees and some t ime these factors are responseble for  creating a strees for an individual performance and group performance. If  organisations focuses more on non-financial factors in comparision to financial  factor so they play a very vital role for improving the performance of  employees and maintaining a harmonious relationship between employer and  employees. </p>
