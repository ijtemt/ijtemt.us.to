<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The term “international competitiveness” has been
associated over time with different definitions andsenses, being 
at the moment one of the most controversial topics  in the field 
of international economics. The lack of competitiveness of many 
European countries vis-à-vis the competitive ones is no longer 
due to the fact that their wages are substantially  lower or that 
labor productivity has not increased. The problem is that they 
are stuck at middle levels of technology. We followthe 
assumption that the technological gap between a frontier and a 
latecomer country represents an important path of 
development for the latter. The approach in this paper is to 
assess countries’ economic development throughout the 
relationship between GDP growth on one hand, and the GDP 
gap, technological competitiveness, capacity competitiveness, 
price competitiveness and investment competitiveness on the 
other hand. We introduced 33 countries (EU27, China, Japan, 
Canada, Norway, Switzerland and USA) observed during 12 
years, from 2000 until 2011. To increase the efficiency of our 
econometric work, we chose to use panel data by taking 
advantage of all the information about the inter-temporal 
dynamics and individuals. The regression was estimated using a 
Random Effects Model and a Random-Effects Linear Model 
with AR (1) disturbance (GLS estimation). In both cases, the 
outcomes proved to be significant, with the expected signs and 
statistically significant coefficients.

  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p>The term  &ldquo;international competitiveness&rdquo; has been associated over time with different  definitions and senses, being at the moment one of the most controversial  topics. The lack of a commonly accepted definition is by far the most important  source of opposition to the concept of macro-economic competitiveness or  international competitiveness. <br>
    In an  increasingly globalizing world, most countries are integrated into the world  economy, voluntarily or by force. International competitiveness has to be in  this context both reflected by internal and external performances. There are a  variety of definitions of competiveness that lead to different indicators, each  with its own particular application. Moreover, for any single concept of  competitiveness, several measures may be constructed, depending on further  specific assumptions. No single measure, or limited set of measures, can  provide all the information required to asses and manage an economy. <br>
    These  measures range from indicators of economic performance, single-factor  indicators, to composite indexes reflecting economic, structural and  institutional factors. <br>
    The  problem of competitiveness is extremely important in the context of European  Union integration, as future member states must integrate into a competitive  economic area. In this context, science, technology and innovation are  acknowledged to be important drivers for the Europe 2020 growth strategy. On 17  July 2012, the Commission adopted its Communication on &ldquo;A Reinforced European  Research Area (ERA) Partnership for Excellence and Growth&rdquo;. ERA is designed to  be a unified research area open to the world and based on the internal market,  in which researchers, scientific knowledge and technology circulate freely.  Having emphasized the role played by innovation and technology in the EU  context, what is deeply important is not the absolute performance, however we  define it, but how well a country performs relative to others.<br>
    In this  paper, follow the work of Fagerberg, we depart from the &ldquo;perfect competition&rdquo;  approach and consider technology as a public good. We develop a model  considering three sets of factors that determine the rate of growth of a  country: the potential to exploit knowledge developed elsewhere, the new  knowledge developed within the country and the capacity to exploit (absorb)  knowledge (independently of where it is created) - the model opens up for  international technology but abstracts from flows of goods and services. Unlike  Fagerberg, we chose to use panel data by using all the information about the  inter-temporal dynamics and individuals. <br>
    The  approach in this paper is to assess countries&rsquo; economic development throughout  the relationship between GDP growth on one hand, and the GDP gap, technological  competitiveness, capacity competitiveness, price competitiveness and investment  competitiveness on the other hand. We follow the assumption that the  technological gap between a frontier and a latecomer country represents an  important path of development for the latter. Technology and capacity competitiveness  are composite indicators based on reliable data sets which were estimated using  a confirmatory factor analysis. Although each and every case is influenced by  specific factors, we will take these into account and integrate them into the  model, as our main purpose is to identify measure and test the impact of some  factors on the economic performance of countries. We developed our model using  a static panel data regression, noting the individual behavior of countries in  a repetitive environment. Matter of fact, what we are trying to emphasize in  this paper are the effects of different dimensions of competitiveness on the  economic performances of countries. The regression was estimated using a Random  Effects Model and an autoregressive AR (1) model (GLS estimation).  In both cases, the outcomes proved to be  significant, with the expected signs and statistically significant  coefficients. <br>
    The plan of the paper is as  follows: the following section reviews the empirical literature in the field of  competitiveness, paying particular attention to technology competitiveness and  capacity to absorb such technology, as two central factors that boost economic  growth; section 3 presents the construction of the two composite indicators  developed in this study and describes the variables used in the model; section  4 presents the methodology chosen for our panel data and section 5 reports the  data and main findings. The outcomes are highlighted in the last section of the  paper.</p>
  <h1>RELATED LITERATURE </h1>
  <p>Although it is widely accepted that is difficult to define, measure  and explain the concept of competitiveness, there are some relevant attempts in  the literature to define and measure international competitiveness. One of the  most important sources I consider to be the work of Jan Fagerberg, who has  developed over time several models of competitiveness. In his papers he deals with  concepts like technology competitiveness,  innovation, economic development and he emphasizes that the difference in  countries&rsquo; development levels are no longer explained by a single factor. According to new growth theory [3], the  knowledge acumulation within national borders is the main factor which  influences economic development. In recent years it was acknowledged especially  among the economists from the filed of international economics the importance  of technological competition. This was also emphasized many years ago by Joseph  Schumpeter [22] who stated that price or cost competitiveness are left behind  by other measures of competitiveness, like new comodity, new technology, new  sources of supply and new type of organization. As Fagerberg described in one  of his articles called &rdquo;International Competitiveness&rdquo; [13] even if a country  is very competitive in terms of technology and prices, it is not always able to  meet the demand for it&rsquo;s products because of a capacity constraint. A logical  conclusion from this would be that the lack of technology and price  competitiveness may be compensated by a high ability to meet demand, if some  other country faces a capacity constraint. The concept of such capacity has a  long history in the literature, authors often refferd to as &bdquo;social capability&rdquo;  [1], &bdquo;absorbtive capacity&rdquo; [8], &bdquo;innovative capacity&rdquo; [20]. As some authors  already emphasized, competences and quality of the  human resources, the specialization in the high-technology sector, together  with the development of the financial system seems to be important structural  factors which are able to stabilize economic development [4]. In recent works,  some authors extended the importance of technological development to the  agriculture sector, highlighting that some of the less developed countries are  still highly dependent on the agriculture  sector, which has significant opportunities of technological and rent upgrading  [9]. <br>
    These concepts were also used to explain differences in  cross-country growth performances. [11]<em> and </em>[17]also found support for  the proposition that R&amp;D and innovation are important for catching-up (and  economic growth more generally). Economic growth is often explained by factors  that are measurable, but there is still a proportion of economic growth that  cannot be explained by measurable factors. Some of these factors are related to  the various aspects and quality of governance, as some studies already  emphasized [21]<em>. </em>As some researchers  already highlighted, the specialization of countries in technology-intensive  products has been shown to be conductive to growth. Differences in geography  and nature are still important for economic growth, as some empirical studies  already exploited the relationship between growth and development [6]. Along  with these factors, we acknowledge that social characteristic of countries are  also important for its development [2], but we decided to consider them as  exogenous in our study. Until recently, there was a lack of reliable  indicators that could be used to put numbers on the so-called many dimensions  of competitiveness, emphasized by the theoretical literature. But in recent  years, the availability and quality of different aspects of development  improved significantly, and this gives researchers new opportunities to  investigate the differences in economic performance among countries, even by  integrating large amounts of information into easily understandable formats, like  for example, composite indicators [14]. Moreover, science, technology and  innovation statistics have been acknowledged in 2010 by the Commission to be  closely linked to the policy activities carried out by the European Union. In  this context, these indicators are key elements that serve at monitoring the  objectives of the Innovation Union initiative and European Research Area (ERA),  under the different priorities of the Europe 2020 Strategy. </p>
  <h1>CONSTRUCTING COMPOSITE INDICATORS </h1>
  <p>The main  purpose of our discussion is to identify measure and test the impact of the  four factors that we consider being of high interest in the context of  different performances of countries. We decided to use composite indices due to  their ability to integrate large amounts of information for a particular  subject of interest. They can be also measured over time and have the ability  to point out the direction of change. Dealing with the fact that there is a lot  of diversity in how countries perform, in this section we develop indicators of  four different aspects of competitiveness. We consider these factors being the  technology competitiveness, capacity competitiveness, price competitiveness and  investment competitiveness. For the first two factors, our approach is to find  reliable indicators and weight them together. To construct indexes of  technological and capacity competitiveness, based on different indicators, it  was necessary to normalize the levels of different activities according to the  size of the country. Although there are a variety of aggregation rules for a  composite indicator in the related literature (e.g. Diewert, 1976, Journal of  Economic and Social Measurement, 2002), in practice a composite indicator, I,  can be considered a weighted linear aggregation rule applied to a set of  variables (OECD, 2003, p. 5):  <br>
    I=Σ wi xi, i = 1,2,..., N <br>
    Where xi  is a scale adjusted variable normalized between zero and one, and wi a  weight attached to xi with Σ wi, i = 1,2,..., N and  and 0≤, wi≤1,  i = 1,2,..., N.  <br>
    Although it was better to have  a-priori knowledge about the &ldquo;weights&rdquo; to use in the construction of the  composites, we applied a confirmatory factor analysis to test the robustness of  the indices and gave each variable an equal [4]. Table III shows the results of  the factor analysis for technology and capacity competitiveness. In both cases,  there is only one factor with a value greater than unity, supporting our belief  that the indicators taken into account do in fact reflect the same dimension. <br>
    <em>Technology competitiveness</em><br>
    Technology is a key factor for the  economic progress. From new inventions like software, robotics and  biotechnology, to improvements in manufacturing systems and processes,  technology makes economies and societies more efficient and productive.  Technology also helps countries to compete more successfully in markets for new  goods and services. Technological competitiveness becomes this way closely related to  innovativeness of a country. Although there are several indicators that measure  directly the innovativeness of a country, the data for some countries are still  lacking. Thus, we decided to use different aspects of the phenomenon, like  R&amp;D expenditures that measures some of the resources that go into  developing new goods and services. Another reliable indicator found in the  literature being highly related to technology competitiveness is the number of  patents of a country. Although these two proxies can be useful tools for  understanding innovation, they are necessarily imperfect measures, because the  propensity to patent varies considerably across industries, with many  innovations not patented (or even patentable). Therefore, we chose to consider  the articles published in scientific and technical journals indicator, as a  measure of the quality of science base. It is widely acknowledged that a  well-developed infrastructure is considered to be of high importance for  innovation, so we introduced in the composite indicator the share of  information and communication technology goods in total exports. We could have  chosen instead the high-technology exports, but since high-technology exports  are products with already incorporated R&amp;D expenditures, we kept only the  R&amp;D expenditures in the composite. Unlike Fargerberg, we didn&rsquo;t take into  consideration the telephone mainlines per head of population, considering it to  be exceeded by the present technological context. In almost all developed  countries the telephone mainlines were cut off and they were replaced by the  mobile phones. Ideally, we would have loved to include data on the diffusion of  new, high-technology goods, like smart-phones or gadgets diffusion throughout  the population, but unfortunately such data are not available, at least at the  moment. <br>
    The technology competitiveness equation is as follows: <br>
    Itech=(25*patent+25*art+25*rd+25*ict)/100            (1)<br>

    <em>Capacity  competitiveness</em><br>
    For a better absorption of  technology, a country must have a good capacity for exploiting it. Even if in  theory the distinction between technology competitiveness and capacity  competitiveness can be clear enough, it is not the same thing in practice,  since resources that are devoted to developing new goods and services may also  be beneficial for the ability to exploit such innovations economically and vice  versa [8]. In our approach the economic capacity of a country should be related  to individual differences of countries in the ability to absorb and transform  resources into valuable activities. These individual differences, according to  Abramovitz [1] are related to three relevant general factors:  technical/organizational competence (level of education), availability/quality  of financial institutions/markets, and quality/efficiency of governance. Thus,  for the capacity competitiveness, we decided to concentrate on the capabilities  that are important for the capacity to exploit technological opportunities.  Although for each of these factors we found reliable indicators, we can say  that all of them can be measured albeit imperfectly. However, by taking into  account a broad range of variables, some of the problems associated with a  particular data source/indicator may be &ldquo;averaged out&rdquo;. For the first factor,  we included secondary school enrollment which emphasizes secondary education.  Regarding the development of the financial system, we took into account the  monetary stability represented by historical record of inflation rates. Even if  we could have chosen several quality/efficiency governance indicators, it is  quite impossible to measure them with precision, especially in time series.  This is because opinion polls and expert assessments might be influenced by  factors other than those we are interested in (e.g. general mood of &ldquo;optimism&rdquo;  among the respondents at the time or the reverse [10]. Although we acknowledge  these facts, we chose to include in the last factor the Physical Rights Index  and Women Political and Economic Rights Index.<br>
    The capacity competitiveness is as  follows:  </p>
  <p>Icap=(20*monstab+20*schoolsecondary+20*phys+20*emp+20*grosssavings)/100            (2)<br>

    <em>Price competitiveness</em><br>
    The general issue concerns the  choice of price or cost measure used. Price and or/cost competitiveness reflects the  traditional view on competitiveness, which emphasizes the potentially damaging effects of excessive wage growth on the  economy. In the literature, there are three  sorts of measures in common use, mostly for industrial countries: those based  on unit labor costs in manufacturing industry; those based on consumer prices;  and those based on export unit values. Recent efforts are trying to broaden the  scope of competitiveness measures, paying more attention to non-manufacturing.  The non-manufacturing outputs are increasingly traded, and services inputs are  frequently considered key components of traded goods (even if these inputs are  themselves not directly traded).&nbsp;For this indicator we choose to use the  growth of real unit labor cost. As Fargerberg [19]  already emphasized, there is no clear trend between the economic growth and the  ULC. Countries with a high ULC can be among the leaders and in the same time  can be among the laggards.<br>

    <em>Investment competitiveness</em><br>
    Private  capital flows are still representing a significant source of investment for all  countries, especially for developing ones, indicating the degree to which a  country have become integrated into the global economy and thus how exposed it  is to any financial shock. &ldquo;FDI triggers technology spillovers, assists human  capital formation, contributes to international trade integration, helps create  a more competitive business environment and enhances enterprise development. These  aspects contribute to higher economic growth, &ldquo;which is the most potent tool  for poverty alleviation&rdquo; [23]. Compared to Portfolio Investment (PI) it is  assumed to be more stable, less prone to volatility and bringing significant  development benefits to the country, but recent evidence questions the idea of  FDI&rsquo;s supposed stability. The consequences of such volatility for growth are  obvious, especially in countries highly reliant on such flows for investment.  When investment sources are unpredictable and volatile, so is growth. For instance, sudden and large inflows of private  capital have been &ldquo;associated with inflationary pressures, a real exchange-rate  appreciation, a deterioration of the current account and a boom in bank lending&rdquo; [7]. Although is evident  which are in this context the macro-economic effects of such volatility on the  poor households, we still have reasons to believe that this factor is important  for increasing domestic consumption or investment. <br>

  <h1>METHODOLOGY </h1>
  <p>Having developed indicators of  different aspects of competitiveness, we apply these indicators in an <strong>Random Effects Model</strong><strong>.</strong> To increase the efficiency  of our econometric work, we chose to use panel data by using all the information about the inter-temporal  dynamics of individuals. Panel data provide information on individual behavior  both across time and across individuals. However, for valid statistical  inference we need to control for likely correlation of regression model errors  over time for a given individual. The usual formula for OLS standard errors in  a pooled OLS regression typically overstates the precision gains, leading to  underestimated standard errors and a t-statistics that can be greatly inflated. <br>
    Although we had a lack of annual  observations for some key variables, the missing observations were  estimated with the help of other indicators with full coverage in the dataset  using the <em>impute </em>procedure in Stata  12. (The number of observations estimated by the procedure is given in the last  column of the <em>Table </em><em>II</em>.). <br>
    In our  model we consider that economic growth should be influenced by five different  factors: the potential for diffusion, growth in technological competitiveness,  growth in capacity competitiveness, growth in price competitiveness and  investment competitiveness. The goal of this estimation is to assess the impact  of the different aspects of competitiveness on economic growth. As for the  total level of technology appropriated in a country (independent of origin)  relative to the frontier (the country considered the most advanced in the  sample), we had to find a proxy. As in other empirical studies in the  literature, we decided to identify the level of technology with the GDP <em>per capita</em>. Therefore, to calculate the  potential for diffusion we used the log of initial level of GDP <em>per capita. </em>The effect of this variable  should be negative, dragging down growth in frontier countries and giving a  boost to those further behind. <br>
    The econometric form of the model  will be:  <br>
    <strong>Δgdp_growthit=β1Y_gapit+  β2Δtechit+ β3Δcapit+ β4Δulcit+  β5cfit +α+ui+εit                     </strong>                        <strong>(3)</strong>           <br>
    <em>i=</em>1,……,33;  t=1,….,12 (<em>time</em>)<strong> </strong><br>
    Where:<br>
    <strong>Δ</strong><strong>gdp_growthit</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>= GDP growth of  country <em>i </em>in time <em>t</em> <br>
    <strong>Y_gapit</strong> = Log of the GDP <em>per capita</em> of  country <em>i </em>in time <em>t</em> <br>
    <strong>Δtechit</strong> = Growth of Technology  Competitiveness Indicator of country <em>i </em>in time <em>t</em> <br>
    <strong>Δcapit</strong> = Growth of Capacity Competitiveness  Indicator of country <em>i </em>in  time <em>t</em> <br>
    <strong> Δulcit</strong> = Growth  of the Real Unit Labor Cost of country <em>i </em>in time <em>t</em> <br>
    <strong> cfit </strong>= Private capital flows of country <em>i </em>in time <em>t</em> <br>
    <strong> β1,  β2, β3 ,β4, β5</strong>=Exogenous  Variables Elasticity&rsquo;s to GDP growth <br>
    <strong><em>v</em></strong><strong>it</strong><strong>= </strong>Residual disturbance term <br>
    In our case we have reason to  believe that there are differences across entities (time invariant country  characteristics) like variables related to geography, demographics or history  that might have some influence on the dependent variable. Taking into account  the problem of omitted exogenous variables and trying to avoid the risk of putting  too much emphasis on –or getting biased estimates of - our different aspects of  competitiveness (explanatory variables) we chose to estimate our model through  a <strong><em>Random  Effect Model</em></strong>, often called the error components model.<br>
    <strong><em>The general form of a Random  Effect Model:</em></strong><strong></strong><br>
    <strong><em>y</em></strong><strong>it=</strong><strong><em> x</em></strong><strong>it</strong><strong> β+ (α +uit)+ εit,         (4) </strong><br>
    <strong><em>i=</em></strong><strong>1<em>,….,</em>N<em> ;t=</em>1,….,T<em> (time)</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><br>
    <strong><em>v</em></strong><strong>it</strong> =<strong> ui</strong> +<strong> εit</strong> <strong> </strong><br>
    <strong>ui=</strong>between entity estimator <br>
    <strong>εit=</strong>within entity estimator <br>
    The random  effects approach specifies that <img src="An_Overview_clip_image028.png" alt="An Overview of the Dynamic Competitiveness of Countries" width="18" height="17"> is a group specific random element which  although random is constant for that group throughout the time period. In this  case, there is a single constant term which is the mean of the unobserved  heterogeneity and ui is the random  heterogeneity specific to the i&rsquo;th observation and is constant throughout time. <br>
    Where:<strong></strong><br>
    <strong><em>x</em></strong><strong>it</strong>=<em>it-th </em>observation on<em> k </em>explanatory variables<br>
    <strong>β</strong> =is the parameter vector<br>
    <strong>ui</strong> =unobserved individual-specific  time-invariant effects<br>
    <strong><em>v</em></strong><strong>it</strong> =residual disturbance term <br>
    <strong><em>v</em></strong><strong>it</strong> has 0 mean, constant variance and is  uncorrelated across time and individuals;<br>
    The model becomes: <br>
    <strong>Δgdp_growthit=β1Y_gapit+  β2Δtechit+ β3Δcapit+ β4Δulcit+  β5cfit +α+ui+εit                                             (5)</strong> <br>
    <strong><em>i=</em></strong><strong>1<em>,….,</em>33<em>  ;t=</em>1,….,12<em> (time)</em></strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><br>
    In a Random  Effect Model, the unobserved heterogeneity is considered to be independently  distributed among the regressors. Compared to fixed effects models, this  stronger assumption has the advantage of permitting consistent estimation of  all parameters, including coefficients of time-invariant regressors. While FE  (Fixed Effects Model) can be inefficient because they throw away important  information, OLS does not exploit the autocorrelation in the composite error  term, making RE (Random Effects Model) more efficient than FE or OLS. In a  Random Effect Model, unobserved individual effects do not contain elements that  are correlated with the regressors, thus we can assume that the unobserved  heterogeneity will not bias the estimates. The variation across entities is  assumed to be random and uncorrelated with the predictor or independent  variables included in the model. Random effects assume that the entity&rsquo;s error  term is not correlated with the predictors which allows for time-invariant  variables to play a role as explanatory variables and also uses feasible GLS  estimation (RE FGLS) to exploit within-cluster correlation. Nevertheless, we  cannot exclude the presence of endogeneity from our model, because of reverse  causality. This so-called endogeneity bias can produce biased estimates from  failing to take into account a possible feedback from economic growth, our  dependent variable on the predictor variables. To address the problem of serial  correlation we estimate the model using a random-effects linear model with an  AR (1) disturbance, but the problem of the so-called endogeneity will  remain unsolved unless we apply the Arellano-Bond estimator, which is not the  case here.</p>
  <h1>EMPIRICAL FINDINGS </h1>
  <p>Our data are strongly balanced, meaning that data are available for  every individual in each year. The database has 33 countries observed during 12  years, from 2000 until 2011. To confirm the decision using a random effects  estimator, we employed a Hausman Test to see whether or not the individual  effects are fixed. Here, the null hypothesis is that the preferred model is  random effects vs. the alternative the fixed effects [12]. It basically tests  whether the unique errors (<img src="An_Overview_clip_image032.png" alt="An Overview of the Dynamic Competitiveness of Countries" width="12" height="16">) are correlated with the regressors. Applying this test, we failed  to reject the null and concluded that we should use a random effects model. As  is often considered in practice, we reject the null hypothesis of the  Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM) that the errors in the  constant-coefficients model are independently and identical distributed,  therefore we estimated the model using random effects GLS. Even if under the  hypothesis of no correlation between regressors and individual effects, Ordinary  Least Squares (OLS) estimators are unbiased and consistent, they are not  efficient. <br>

  <p> Robust standard errors in parentheses *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1;The dependent variable is growth of GDP  (in PPPs constant international USD). β values of the parameters are reported.  *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels.<br>
    We controlled for heteroskedasticity using the Windmeijer corrected  standard errors (option cluster–robust VCE in Stata). Clustering on  the panel variable produces an estimator of the VCE that is robust to  cross-sectional heteroskedasticity and within-panel (serial) correlation. The F  test is significant at 10% level, meaning that our model is correctly specified  and all the coefficients are different from 0. The coefficients for the five  variables included in the model all having the expected signs, significantly  different from zero at 0,5% level, bring strong support to the model. There are R2  figures relating to &lsquo;within-groups&rsquo; and &lsquo;between groups&rsquo;. Basically the within  groups R2 with a value of 0.13 is the explanatory power due to the  right hand side variables explaining changes in GDP growth for individual  countries. This is relatively low compared to the R2 between groups  with a value of 0,50 but is not surprising as the differences in GDP growth  comes from countries specific characteristics, like geography, nature or  history, as we previously mentioned. <br>
    The interpretation of the coefficients includes  both the within-entity and between-entity effects. In our case when technology  competitiveness changes across time and between countries by one unit, the GDP  growth will increase in average by 0,38. The same direct and positive  relationship is valid for the capacity competitiveness, only that when capacity  competitiveness changes across time and between countries by one unit, the GDP growth will  increase in average by 2,11. Although the sign of the effect is the expected  one, the quantitative effect is high, which implies that above average growth  of capacity competitiveness will strongly boost economic growth. Our analysis  also confirms that ULC affects the economic performance of a country, an  increase in ULC by one unit decreases the level of economic growth by 0,21. The  quantitative effect of the ULC variable is quite significant, showing that  above average growth of the real unit labor cost does hamper economic growth.  Also, a higher growth can be achieved due to more efficient investment. Changes  in private capital flows across time and between countries by one unit produces  an increase of 0,01 units in GDP growth. The outcomes support our belief that  individual factors related to geography (elevation point, latitude, longitude,  access to navigable rivers, quality of soil, climate) or even initial  endowments of countries are important for economic growth and increase the  explanatory power of the regression. Our model does not take into consideration  the effects on economic growth of the political stability, the quality of  macroeconomic policy, income inequality and financial depth and so on. Hence,  there is a clear path that we should develop and apply more rigorous estimation  methods. <br>
    Even though we took into account the fact that  units have something in common (unit-specific residuals) and that observations  are non-independent (by using cluster option), there can still be additional  problems related to the autocorrelation of residuals. To test for serial  correlation we employed a Lagram-Multiplier test for serial correlation,  rejecting the null and concluding that the data is first-order autocorrelated.  Therefore, in order to explicitly account for autoregressive error term and to  eliminate the endoneneity bias we used a random-effects linear model with an AR  (1) disturbance. The results are shown in <em>Table  I column b.</em><br>
    From this table we can observe that the two  composite indicators have the same signs and the coefficients are still  statistically significant, supporting the robustness of the model. Even though  none of the coefficients have changed significantly from a quantitative point  of view, the overall R2   of  the model improves. <br>
    We tested for autocorrelation using  the option lbi in Stata, based on the Durbin-Watson statistic. A value of the  modified Durbin-Watson statistic or Baltagi<em>-</em>Wu  LBI<em>-</em>statistic of 2 indicates  no autocorrelation. A DW statistic that will lie in the 0-4 range, with a value  near two will indicate no first-order serial correlation. Positive serial  correlation is associated with DW values below 2 and negative serial correlation  with DW values above 2. Although a strict interpretation of the DW statistic  can be difficult, having a reported value of the Durbin-Watson of 1.2440263 and  of the Baltagi-Wu LBI of 1.3314505 for our model, we concluded that is no need  for extra serial correction.</p>
  <h1>CONCLUSIONS </h1>
  <p>The results reported  in this article are arguably consistent with other lessons from the literature.  Our empirical analysis, based on a sample of 33 countries during 2000-2011  demonstrated the relevance of technology, capacity, price and investment  competitiveness for economic growth. Deteriorating technology and capacity  competitiveness, together with an unfavorable geography, nature and climate,  are among the main factors that trigger down growth in many developing  countries and hamper them in exploiting the potential for catching up with  other countries in terms of technology and income. <br>
    Both indicators of technology and  capacity competitiveness have significant quantitative effects on growth and  remain statistically significant during both estimation methods in our paper.  Although technology is important for development, the capacity to exploit such  technology matter in the same proportion, because of its multi-dimensional  character. As for price competitiveness, although the quantitative effect is  relatively small, it implies a negative influence on economic development. As  for the investment competitiveness indicator, it has the expected sign and  positive effects on economic development. In the context of technological development,  this indicator is important because theory suggests that sometimes capital  flows will move towards countries that have a significant level of technology.  Although this might be part true, capital flows will also move towards  countries with limited capital, because the returns on investments will be  higher where capital is scarce, helping them   to catch-up with the leaders.<br>
    The outcomes highlighted by our  approach can serve as an important proof that small and medium-sized European  countries can attain very high levels of development throughout technology and  capacity. These should serve as main concerns for policy-makers.<br>
    In this case, what were considered to  be the problems facing by peripheral countries when talking about  competitiveness is no longer true, at least not entirely true: their lack of  competitiveness vis-à-vis the developed countries is not due to the fact that  their wages are substantially lower or that labor productivity has not  increased. The problem is that they are stuck at middle levels of technology  and they are caught in a trap. Although the economic crisis has challenged  popular conceptions of economic growth, it is well acknowledged that the main  objective of countries has to remain the one to deliver smart and sustainable  technology output and to find the path to create new jobs and to offer  macroeconomic stability.</p>
