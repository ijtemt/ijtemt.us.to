Paper Title :<br>A Study On Agricultural Wage – Productivity 
Relationship With Reference To Groundnut Crop 
In Chittoor District (Andhra Pradesh)</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The increase in production and productivity are 
influencing agricultural wages. But the results of  empirical 
studies have shown a positive relationship between  real wages 
and productivity. It is also observed that the realwages seem to 
have declined or remained stagnant in spite of increasing 
agricultural production. However, a close relationship may be 
found between wages and productivity. There are number of 
studies on the agricultural sector in Chittoor district. But the 
research on agricultural wage – productivity relationship is very 
limited. This paper aims to study the Agricultural  Wage – 
Productivity Relationship with reference to Groundnut crop in 
Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh. An attempt has been made to 
study the relationship between wages and yield, output price of 
major crop ‘Groundnut’ for entire district as a whole. A 
regression model is used to study the relationship.In the present 
study, the relevant secondary data for explanatory and explained 
variables is collected from the Census of India 1991 : Population 
Census and also from handbook of statistics and other 
unpublished official records of the Chief Planning  Officer, 
Chittoor. The primary data required is collected through field 
survey : 1998-99. In case of female agricultural labour, 
regarding the lagged yields, the rate of increase in real wages 
(0.19) is twice as compared to that of money wages.This increase 
in real wages over money wages reveals that the economic 
position of the female agricultural labour may be increased due 
to raise in lagged yields. Owing to the lagged price, the rate of 
increase in real wages of female agricultural labour (0.39) as 
compared to the female agricultural money wages (1.41) is 
approximately one forth. This result shows that about 3/4
th of the monetary gains of the female agricultural labour has been taken away by consumer price rise. From this rate of increase in real 
wages, it may be concluded that the real economic position of the 
female agricultural labour has been deteriorated marginally. The 
same variables for the male population is studied and analysed . 
Further, the same was calculated separately for thethree revenue 
divisions of Chittoor District.

  <h1> Introduction</h1>
  <p>The term agricultural productivity we mean the varying relationship  between the agricultural output and one of the major input such as land. The  most commonly used term for representing agricultural productivity is the  average yield per hectare of land. After the introduction of modern  agricultural technique along with the adoption of hybrid seeds, extension of  irrigation facilities and application of intensive methods of cultivation in  India, yield per hectare of all crops has recorded a steep rising trend.<br>
    Agricultural  productivity in India has undergone an abrupt change in the Post-Green  Revolution period. But the fruits of green revolution were mostly available to  some particular states only, as the introduction of new agricultural strategy  was very much restricted into some particular states like Punjab, Haryana and  Western Uttarpradesh. Thus while the agricultural productivity in all other  states remained more or less static or increased slowly but the agricultural  productivity of some crops in those particular states adopting new agricultural  strategy has increased substantially. All these had led to a high degree of  inter-state differences in agricultural productivity in the country.<br>
    The condition  of Indian agriculture still largely remains backward although it is considered  as the backbone of the Indian economy. Agriculture productivity which is  composed of both productivity of land and labour as well, is among the lowest  in the world. Average yield per hectare in India is quite below the world  average in all crops. It is much lower as compared with even the yield rates  prevailing in less advanced countries of the world. With the introduction of  economic planning in India, although some steps have been undertaken for  improving the conditions of agriculture, its conditions have not changed much.<br>
    In subsistence  farming, the relation between wages and productivity is not like that in the modern  sector where additional labour is employed to increase output and we imagine an  employer equating wages with the marginal product. Wages and productivity are  related in the sense that wages are paid out of total product, which depends  upon productivity.<br>
    The increase in  production and productivity are influencing agricultural wages. But the results  of empirical studies have shown a positive relationship between real wages and  productivity. It is also observed that the real wages seem to have declined or  remained stagnant in spite of increasing agricultural production. However, a  close relationship may be found between wages and productivity.<br>
    There are number of studies on the  agricultural sector in Chittoor district. But the research on agricultural wage  – productivity relationship is very limited. Hence an attempt is made to study  the Agricultural Wage – Productivity Relationship with reference to Groundnut  crop in Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh.</p>
  <h1>OBJECTIVES</h1>
  <p>The following is the objective of the study:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To study the Agricultural Wage –  Productivity Relationship with reference to Groundnut crop in Chittoor  district, Andhra Pradesh.</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>METHODOLOGY</h1>
  <p>An attempt has been made to study the relationship between wages and  yield, output price of major crop &lsquo;Groundnut&rsquo; for entire district as a whole.  Therefore the following regression model is proposed to study the relationship.<br>

  <p>                Where,<br>
    Y    = Real/money wagerate<br>
    X1  =   Lagged yield (Quintals per hectare)<br>
    X2  = Lagged price (Rs. Per quintal)</p>
  <p>                                a,  b and c are the constants.</p>
  <p>                Both the linear  and log-linear models have been estimated to the above model and it is decided  that the log – linear model yields good results. Hence, the analysis has been  carried out to log – linear model only. The log – linear model is as follows :<br>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the present study, the relevant  secondary data for explanatory and explained variables is collected from the  Census of India 1991 : Population Census and also from handbook of statistics  and other unpublished official records of the Chief Planning Officer, Chittoor.  The primary data required is collected through field survey : 1998-99.</p>
  <h1>FINDINGS</h1>
  <p>It is proposed to study the relationship between wages with yield  and output prices per quintal of groundnut. Between the linear and log-linear  estimates; log-linear model gives better results than the linear estimates. The  equation (2) given in the methodology is estimated. The results were analysed  based on log-linear estimates for the entire district as a whole.<br>
    The estimated  regression equation for female money wagerate is<br>
    <br>
    Y = -7.2169 + 0.0821 X1  +1.4356* X2<br>
    (0.2840)          (0.1258)</p>
  <p>                                R2  =   0.9064 ,            F = 76.8136*</p>
  <p>   *  Significant at 5 per cent probability level.</p>
  <p>                The two  estimated regression co-efficients of lagged yield (X1) and lagged  price (X2) are positive. It means, the effect of these two variables  on money wagerate (Y) is positive. An increase in these two variables will  increase the female money wagerate in Chittoor district. An increase in one  unit of lagged yield will increase the female money wagerate by 0.08 units, but  this increase is not significant. Similarly, an increase in one unit of lagged  price will increase the female money wagerate by 1.44 units. This increase is  significant. Hence, female money wages are influenced by changes in the yield  and prices of output. One unit increase in output would result in more than one  unit increase in money wage showing the improvements in real wages. With  respect to the groundnut yield, the positive co-efficients of yield implying  that wages are influenced by changes in the yields. It indicates that the  benefits of technology has not reached the agricultural labourers at  significant level. This indicates that the benefits which accrued to the  groundnut farmers through a rise in the output prices also percolated to the  agricultural labourers. The                  co-efficient of constant or intercept is -7.2169. It means the factors  which are not considered in the model shows negative effect on female money  wages. The collective effect of the two independent variables – X1  and X2 is shown by the value of R2. The value of R2  is 0.9064. It indicates that 90.64 percent of variation in female money  wagerate is observed by these two independent variables. The value of R2  is significant.<br>
    <br>
    The estimated regression  equation for female real wagerate is<br>
    <br>
    Y = -4.392 + 0.1886 X1  +0.3938* X2<br>
    (0.1505)        (0.0666)</p>
  <p>                                R2  =   0.7541 ,            F = 51.4269*</p>
  <p>   *  Significant at 5 percent probability level.</p>
  <p><strong>                </strong>The two estimated  regression co-efficients of independent variables – X1 and X2  are positive. It means the effect of these two variables on female real  wagerate (Y) is positive. An increase in these two variables will increase the  female real wagerate in Chittoor district. An increase in one unit of lagged  yield will increase the female real wagerate by 0.19 units. But this increase  is not significant. Similarly, an increase in one unit of lagged price will  increase the female real wagerate by 0.39 units. This increase is significant.  Hence, female real wages are influenced by changes in the yield and prices of  output. The co-efficient of constant or intercept is -4.392. It means, the  factors which are not considered in the model show negative effect on female  real wages. The collective effect of the two independent variables – X1  and X2 is shown by the value of R2. The value of R2  is 0.7541. It indicates that, 75.46 percent of variation in female real  wagerate is observed by these two independent variables. The value of R2  is significant. <strong>   </strong></p>
  <p>The estimated regression equation for male  money wagerate is<br>
    <br>
    Y = -6.8562 + 0.0901*  X1 +1.4094* X2<br>
    (0.0349)          (0.0155)</p>
  <p>                                R2  =   0.8982 ,            F = 70.5855*</p>
  <p>   *  Significant at 5 percent probability level.</p>
  <p>                The two  estimated regression co-efficients of lagged yield (X1) and lagged  price (X2) are positive and significant. It means the positive  relationship is observed between independent variables - X1 and X2  with dependent variable (Y). An increase in these two variables will increase  the male money wagerate in Chittoor district. An increase in one unit of lagged  yield will increase the male money wagerate by 0.09 units. But this increase is  significant. Similarly, an increase in one unit of lagged price will increase  the male money wagerate by 1.41 units. This increase is significant. Hence, male  money wages are influenced by changes in the yield and prices of output. One  unit increase in groundnut price would result in more than one unit increase in  money wage showing the improvements in real wages. The positive and significant  co-efficient of yield reveals that wages are influenced by changes in the  yield. It mean the benefits of technology have reached the agricultural  labourers at significant level. It indicates that a rise in the output prices  is beneficial to the groundnut farmers which in turn effects the agricultural  labourers. The co-efficient of intercept is -6.8562. It means the factors which  are not considered in the model show negative effect on male money wages. The  collective effect of the two independent variables - X1 and X2  is shown by the value of R2. The value of R2 is 0.8982.  It indicates a variation of 89.82 percent in male money wagerate is observed by  these two independent variables. The value of R2 is significant.</p>
  <p>The estimated regression equation for male  real wagerate is<br>
    <br>
    Y = -0.2138 – 0.0513 X1  +0.3252* X2<br>
    (0.0189)         (0.0835)</p>
  <p>                                R2  =   0.6702 ,            F = 16.267*</p>
  <p>   *  Significant at 5 percent probability level.</p>
  <p>                The estimated  co-efficient of lagged yield (X1) is negative and insignificant. It means  the negative relationship is observed between X1 variable and male  real wagerate. An increase in the lagged yield will decrease the male real  wagerate in Chittoor district. The estimated co-efficient of lagged price (X2)  is positive and significant. It means the effect of independent variable (X2)  on male real wagerate is positive. An increase in the lagged price will  increase the male real wagerate in the district. An increase in one unit of X1  variable will decrease the male real wagerate (Y) by 0.05 units. But this  decrease is not significant. Similarly, an increase in one unit of X2  variable will increase the male real wagerate (Y) by 0.33 units. This increase  is significant. Hence, male real wages are affected by changes in the yield and  prices of output. The co-efficient of constant is -0.2138. It means the factors  which are not considered in the model show negative effect on male real wages.  The collective effect of the two independent variables - X1 and X2  are shown by the value of R2. The value of R2 is 0.6702.  It indicates that, 67.02 percent of variation in male real wagerate is observed  by these two independent variables. The value of R2 is significant.</p>
  <h1>CONCLUSIONS</h1>
  <p>In case of female  agricultural labour, regarding the lagged yields, the rate of increase in real  wages (0.19) is twice as compared to that of money wages. This increase in real  wages over money wages reveals that the economic position of the female  agricultural labour may be increased due to raise in lagged yields. Owing to  the lagged price, the rate of increase in real wages of female agricultural  labour (0.39) as compared to the female agricultural money wages (1.41) is  approximately one forth. This result shows that about 3/4th of the  monetary gains of the female agricultural labour has been taken away by  consumer price rise. From this rate of increase in real wages, it may be  concluded that the real economic position of the female agricultural labour has  been deteriorated marginally.<br>
    Whereas for male agricultural  labour, in case of lagged yield is observed that there is a decreasing trend in  male real wages (-0.05) and an increasing trend in male money wages (0.09).  This results indicates that the declining trend in real economic position of  the male agricultural labour. With respect to the lagged price, the rate of  increase in real wages of male agricultural labour (0.32) as compared to the  male money wages (1.41) is just marginal. This results tells that about 3/4th  of the monetary gains of the male agricultural labour has been taken away by  consumer price rise. From this rate of increase in real wages, it may be  concluded that the real economic conditions of the male agricultural labour has  been decreased marginally.</p>
