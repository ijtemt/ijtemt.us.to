<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>The reporting of environmental management  by companies is an important factor in the management of environmental  transparency. A company is as one of the main contributors to the economic  growth of a country, as well as the dominant contributor to the environmental  problems that is caused by the process of production that uses natural sources (Ja&rsquo;far,  2008). Environmental management disclosure in the annual report is a form of  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to determine the ecological impact on a  company's economic performance.<br>
  Indonesian Government makes the rules that  encourage the creation of environmental performance and encourage go public  companies to report environmental management in the company's annual report (Nurlela  &amp; Islahuddin, 2008). The regulation that is related to the environment has  begun to be applied in Indonesia. The awareness of the need to preserve the  environment is regulated by Law No. 40 of 2007 on Limited Liability Company  (Perseroan Terbatas/ PT) especially in Article 66 and Article 74, which state  that companies conducting business in the field of natural resources or related  natural resources are required to conduct CSR.<br>
  The report of CSR by companies in  Indonesia before 2007 was still a voluntary disclosure. As the reporting is  voluntary, governments, companies, and communities would be throwing the  responsibility on the issue of environmental damage to each other. After 2007,  the perception of CSR was slowly shifting from voluntary to the form of action  on the basis of moral and legal obligation.<br>
  Companies are increasingly compelled to  disclose CSR in its annual report by the government regulations that require  the disclosure of CSR. Before the CSR disclosure was required in 2007, the  transparency of CSR disclosure of companies was quite low. The results of a  research conducted by Yuniarti (2003) states that companies listed on the Stock  Exchange prior to the date December 31, 2000 had a low level of CSR disclosure.  However Ja'far and Amalia (2006) state that the seriousness of public companies  in managing the environment began to raise. <br>
  Based on the explanation, this study develops  a theoretical and empirical framework related to the differences of CSR  disclosures transparency before and after the implementation of the Law of  Republic Indonesia Number 40 of 2007. Therefore this study investigates whether  there are differences in CSR disclosure transparency before and after the CSR  disclosures are required. Being based on CSR disclosure transparency before and  after the CSR disclosures are required, this study empirically investigates the  phenomena related to the claim that there are differences in CSR disclosure  transparency before and after the CSR disclosures are required.</p>
<h1>Literature Review </h1>
<h2>Corporate Social Responsibility  Disclosure </h2>
<p>CSR is the mechanism for an organization  to voluntarily integrate social and environmental concerns into its operations  and interaction with stakeholders, which exceeds the organizational  responsibilities in the field of law (Anggraini, 2006). CSR, according to  Suharto (2008) is a business operation that is committed not only to increase  the company's profit financially, but also for socio-economic development of  the region holistically, institutionalized, and sustainable. Some other names  that are similar and often associated with CSR is corporate giving, corporate  philanthropy, corporate community relations, and community development. In terms of motivation, these four terms can be  interpreted as a dimension or approach to CSR. A  company conducts corporate giving based on charity principle. The second  dimension of CSR is corporate philanthropy which is based on the principles of  humanity. The third dimension of the CSR is  corporate community relations which is conducted to create a harmonious and balanced  company relationship, and in accordance with the environment, values, norms,  and culture of the local community. The last  dimension of CSR is community development which is based on the concern of  community development.<br>
  The term CSR was becoming more popular in  the 1970s, especially after the book <em>Cannibals  with Forks</em> appeared: &quot;The Triple Bottom Line in 21st Century  Business&quot; (Elkington, 1997). Elkington (1997) developed the three  essential components of sustainable development, namely economic growth,  environmental protection, and social equity, initiated by The World Commission  on Environment and Development (WCED) in the Brundtland Report in 1987 and  packed CSR into three focus, namely 3P (profit, planet and people). The understanding of 3P is that the business purpose  that is not only seeking for profit, but also considers the welfare of the  people, and ensures the sustainability of life on the planet (Ajilaksana, 2011).<br>
  Company concern to the public could be  considered as an increase in the participation and position of the organization  within the community through various efforts of shared prosperity for the  organization and the community (Asy&rsquo;ari, 2009). Susanto (2005) also stated that  CSR is not just a charity, but it requires a firm in decision making in order  to seriously take into account about the effect of all corporate stakeholders,  including the environment. Therefore, companies have to make a balance between  the importance of stakeholders, and an important aspect of CSR is how companies  disclose CSR to society.<br>
  CSR disclosure is as the presentation of a  number of information needed for companies operating in the capital market  optimally and efficiently (Nurlela &amp; Islahuddin, 2008). CSR disclosure in  the annual report of companies in Indonesia before 2007 was voluntary, but  after 2007, CSR disclosure is mandatory. Information disclosure must be  conducted by companies that are based on certain rules or standards that are  made by the government.</p>
<h2>New Policy of the Republic  Indonesia </h2>
<p>Government policy is a boost to the  company's environmental management practices, either in the form of laws, regulations,  incentives, and pressures. Law No. 40 of 2007 which is a substitute of Law No.  1 of 1995 firmly and clearly mention that CSR must be accounted by a Limited  Liability Company. Based on the 161 chapter explained, there are two articles  that regulate CSR, namely Article 66 and Article 74.<br>
  Article 66 subsection (2) section c states  that in addition to submit financial statements, Limited Liability Companies  are also required to report on the implementation of CSR, which is as follows:<br>
  Article  66 subsection (1): Directors are to submit an annual report to the AGM after  review by the Board of Commissioners at the latest within a period of 6 (six)  months after the fiscal year of the Company ends.<br>
  subsection(2): The annual report referred to subsection  (1) shall contain at least: ...<br>
  c. &quot;Report on the  implementation of Social and Environmental Responsibility;&quot;<br>
  Article 74 Outlined the CSR, especially  for a company that owns businesses in the area and or relating to natural  resources, as follows:<br>
  Article 74 subsection (1):   The  Company that is conducting its business activities in the field and / or  related to the natural resources is required to implement the Social and  Environmental Responsibility.<br>
  subsection  (2):       Social and Environmental Responsibility  as referred to subsection (1) is an obligation of the Company and calculated as  the cost of the Company's implementation that is conducted with regard to the  appropriateness and reasonableness.<br>
  subsection  (3):      The Company that do not carry  out the obligations referred to subsection (1) is to be sanctioned in  accordance with the provisions of the legislation.<br>
  subsection  (4):       Further provisions on Social  and Environmental Responsibility set by government regulation. <br>
  Referring to the two articles in Law No.  40 of 2007, A Limited Liability Company would not underestimate CSR (Ja&rsquo;far  &amp; Amalia, 2006). In addition to submit financial report, Limited Liability  Company is also required to report the implementation of CSR. For Limited  Liability Companies that have the business in natural resources or related  field in natural resources, will be subject to sanctions if they do not  implement CSR. This is proof that the government is serious about addressing  social problems as social problems could cause harm to stakeholders. In  addition to the opinion, the government also said that according to the House  of Representatives (DPR), the compulsory of CSR has also been regulated in Law  Number 25 of 2007 about Investment (UU PM). The consistency in compulsory CSR  does exist, however, the Law No. 40 of 2007 has extended the coverage of  compulsory of CSR, that is companies that have to disclose the CSR in their  annual reports are all Limited Liability Companies.<br>
  A CSR violation is subject to criminal  sanctions as stipulated in Law No. 23 of 1997 on Environmental Management  (UUPLH) (Sutopoyudo, 2009):<br>
  Article 41 subsection  (1): &quot;Any person who knowingly commit unlawful acts that result in  pollution and / or destruction of the environment, punishable with a maximum  imprisonment of ten years and a maximum fine of five hundred million  dollars&quot;.<br>
  Article 42 subsection  (1): &quot;Any person who by reason of negligence that resulted in acts of  pollution and / or destruction of the environment, punishable with a maximum  imprisonment of three years and a maximum fine of one hundred million  dollars&quot;.<br>
  CSR disclosure in annual reports is also  stated in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 1 (Revised  1998) ninth subsection:<br>
  <em>The  Company may also present additional statements such as statements regarding to  the environment and report value added (value added statement), especially for  industries where environmental factors play an important role and the industry  that considers employees as a group of users report that plays an important  role.</em></p>
<h1>Theoretical Framework </h1>
<p>The theoretical framework of the study is  to analyze the differences of transparency of corporate social responsibility  disclosures before and after the implementation of the Law of the Republic  Indonesia Number 40 of 2007. A study conducted by Yuniarti (2003) shows that a  company CSR disclosure before the activation of Law No. 40 Year 2007 regarding  disclosure of CSR that has turned into mandatory could be said to be very low in  its transparency. Law Number 40 of 2007 on  Limited Liability Companies that have been authorized by the government on July  20, 2007 and began to be activated on August 16, 2007 set the company's  obligation to program and implements CSR. These laws take were first to be  implement in companies that have business activities in areas that is related  to natural resources, the companies use natural resources and produce waste  that can harm the environment. With CSR  disclosure obligations under applicable Law No. 40 of 2007, it is widely  expected to increase the transparency of CSR disclosure by the company. This  obligation is also expected to change the paradigm of voluntary CSR into  mandatory.<br>
  Environmental performance is strongly  influenced by external factors such as government policies, and internal  factors such as management's willingness to undertake proactive environmental  management as part of the company's CSR (Pfleiger, 2005). These factors can  influence the environmental management measures that further encourages  management to create environmental performance and reveals the performance in a  public report.<br>
  A research that was conducted by Ja'far  and Amalia (2006) shows the seriousness of public companies in managing the  environment in a good way, because many sample companies reported environmental  management in the annual report. Based on the above explanation, the hypothesis  is formulated as follows:<br>
  H1: There are  differences in CSR disclosure transparency before and after the CSR disclosures  are absolutely required.</p>
<h1>Methodology </h1>

Sampling process in this study is purposive  sampling with the following criteria: (1) manufacturing company listed on the  Stock Exchange in 2004 and 2010 respectively, (2) the company's annual report  as the samples are available in full, (3) Statements finance is presented in  Rupiah, (4) There is a CSR disclosure in annual reports from 2004 to 2010  respectively.<br>
  CSR disclosure in this study is using the  standard Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), it is as follows: (1) economic  performance indicators, (2) environment performance indicators, (3) labor  practices performance indicators, (4) human rights performance indicators, (5)  social performance indicators, (6) product responsibility performance  indicators. CSR disclosure indicator has a maximum total value is 79. At each statement of GRI indicators, assessment is  conducted by using dummy variables, namely: the value 0, if the company does  not disclose details of CSR disclosures including GRI indicators in the annual  reports, and a value of 1, if the company has revealed details of CSR  disclosures included in the annual report GRI indicators. Assessment will be  weighted CSR with a total maximum value of the six indicators after all the  details are given assessment statement GRI indicators. CSR Disclosure Index by  Dahlia and Siregar (2008) is formulated as follows:</p>

<p>Information :<br>
  CSRIj     = CSR <em>Disclosure  Index</em> company j<br>
  n              = the amount of item for the company (79)<br>
  ∑Xij        = total value <em>dummy  variable</em> (≤ 79)</p>
<p>The method of analysis used in this study is to test the hypothesis  was paired sample T-test. According to Kusumadilaga  (2010) significance level (a) is set at 5%,  which means the error  rate of this study was 5%.</p>
<h1>Findings and Data Analysis</h1>
<p>Descriptive statistics provide an overview of  the research variable  characteristics of CSR disclosure index. Based  on purposive sampling  method used in sampling,  the whole data is valid in this study; there are a total of 77 companies. The final result data for the mean, minimum  value, maximum value, and the standard deviation  in this study  during the study period  are presented in Table 1.</p>

<p>The descriptive  statistics testing that are presented in Table 1 shows the transparency of CSR  disclosure of a company which was measured by CSR Disclosure Index. Descriptive  statistical analyzes which were performed show that CSR Disclosure Index has an  average value of 0.1972 or 19.72% and a standard deviation of 0.10239 or  10.24%. The lowest value of CSR Disclosure Index of 0.05 for CSR disclosure in  2004 and 2005. The highest value of CSR Disclosure Index of 0.49 for CSR in  2010.<br>
  After conducting  descriptive statistical analysis, hypothesis testing is carried out by using  Paired Sample T-Test. The first hypothesis test results are presented in Table  2 indicates that the value of significance  (Sig.) of CSR Disclosure Index variable of 0.000 (&lt;0,05). Significance of  CSR Disclosure Index is smaller than the tolerance limit, so H1 is accepted,  indicating that there are differences in CSR Disclosure Index before and after  the CSR disclosures are required. The interpretation of the results of the  study is that there are differences in CSR Disclosure Index before and after the  CSR disclosures are required, and these differences indicate an increase in the  transparency of CSR disclosure.</p>

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>The implementation of Law No. 40 of 2007 is  quite effective; it is proven by the presence of the increasing transparency in  the disclosure of CSR undertaken by manufacturing firms although still not  optimal. The result of this study is in a way with the research conducted by  Yuniarti (2003) and Ja'far and Amalia (2006).<br>
  Yuniarti (2003) proves that the  transparency of CSR is still very low before CSR disclosures are required. The  result of the testing of the first hypothesis is also consistent with the  research conducted by Ja'far and Amalia (2006). The research that was conducted  by Ja'far and Amalia (2006) shows that Limited Liability Company began to be  serious in managing the environment in a good way, because many sample  companies reported environmental management in the annual report.<br>
  The seriousness of public companies in CSR  reporting is proven because since 2007 till now there is increasing  transparency of CSR disclosure as measured by the CSR Disclosure Index that are  presented in Table 2 that shows that there is an increase in the average value  of CSR disclosure transparency by 112%. The increasing transparency of CSR  disclosure shows that after the government makes policy on CSR disclosure in  the annual report of 2007, the company's point of view about CSR that was  originally voluntary CSR is gradually shifted into the form of action on the basis  of moral and legal obligation.<br>
  The first hypothesis testing results  indicate that the government's policy on disclosure of CSR has managed to  encourage companies to comply with regulations on CSR disclosure in annual  reports and managed to push the company to maintain the welfare of the  environment. The company also became more responsible for environmental damage  and the surrounding community. Various forms of efforts to reduce greenhouse  gas emissions and industrial waste as well as reducing energy consumption have  been done by the company, even some companies recycle raw materials.</p>
<h1>Conclusion, Limitations, and  Future Research</h1>
<p>Based on the discussion of the results of  data analysis that have been described, it can be concluded that there are  differences in CSR disclosure transparency before and after the CSR disclosures  are required. The results indicate that the government's policy on disclosure  of CSR could improve the transparency of CSR disclosure.<br>
  Sample selection criteria regarding to the  company's annual report which is available completely cannot be found. Many  companies do not present the complete annual report on the website and not all  annual report data could be found in the BEI, so  the results may not generalize the state of the population. Based on the limitations that have been presented in  this study, the suggestions for future studies should use more sample of  companies, not just the manufacturing industry and years of observation further  expanded to better generalize the state of the population. In addition, further  research can add variable financial performance in order to assess the  performance of the company associated with the implementation of the Law of the  Republic Indonesia Number 40 of 2007.</p>
