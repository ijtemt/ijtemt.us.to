Paper Title :<br>Banking Sector Reforms And Economic Performance:<br>
Analysis Using Credit To Private Sector</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This study focuses on the implications of 
Credit to private Sector on the economic 
growth of Nigeria. Reforms have been 
introduced and implemented in Nigeria over 
the last three decades. The impact of these 
reforms on the economic growth have not been 
well felt by the citizens. The study is to 
determine the relationship between Credit to 
private Sector and economic growth of Nigeria. 
Regression model was used to present the 
estimates evaluated with T-test, F-test, DW-test 
and standard error estimates used to test the 
level of significance. The study found out 
statistical significance between Credit to 
Private Sector (CPS) and Real Gross Domestic 
Product (RGDP) in billions (N).furthermore, if 
there is one (1) million of Credit Private Sector 
(CPS) in the economy, the real output (RGDP) 
of the economy will increase by some 
significant percent of total increase in Credit to 
Private Sector (CPS).The Nigerian banking 
sector should increase the amount of credit 
given to private sector; this will in turn 
contributes greatly to the growth of Real Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) bringing about 
increase in economic growth of the economy at 
large. The research concludes that bank 
reforms have resulted in making banks more 
efficient, reliable and their intermediating 
potentials have also been revived.

    <strong><em>Keywords</em></strong><em>:  Bank, reforms, economic growth, credit and private sector    <strong></strong></em></p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The  relevance of banks in the economy of any nation cannot be overemphasized. They  are the cornerstones of the economy of a country. The encyclopedia Americana  International edition put the position thus &ldquo;economic activities as it is known  could not be sailing without the continuing flow of money and credit. The  economies of all market oriented nation depend on the efficient operation of  complex and delicately balanced systems of money and credit. Banks are  indispensable element in these systems. They provide the bulk of the money  supply as well as the primary means of facilitating the flow of credit&rdquo;.  Consequently, it&rsquo;s submitted that the economic wellbeing of a nation is a  function of advancement and development of her banking industry and the economy  at large.<strong></strong><br>
    The  financial deregulation in Nigeria that started in 1987 and the associated  financial innovations have generated an unprecedented degree of competition in  the banking industry. The deregulation initially pivoted powerful aid for the  expansion of both size and number of banking and non-banking institutions. The  consequent phenomenal increase in the number of banking and non-banking  institutions providing financial services led to increased competition amongst  various banking institutions, and between banks and non-banking financial  intermediaries all targeted at increasing the level of economic growth.<strong> </strong>Apart from the keen competition with  the range of financial activities, banks have also faced problems associated  with a persistent slowdown in economic activities viz economic growth, severe  political instability, virulent inflation, worsening economic financial  conditions of their corporate borrowers and increasing incidence of fraud and  embezzlement of funds. Hence, the continuing decline in the financial standard  of banks and increasing incidence of bank failure since deregulation have  raised question about the state and nature of the Nigerian banking sector.<br>
    Banks  facilitate economic growth in variety of ways. In the first instance, they act  as financial intermediaries between the surplus generating units and the  deficit spending ones. Ubom (2009) This is a twofold function involving the  mobilization of saving from the former group which are then channeled to the  later to support productive economic activities, Afolabi (2006). This  intermediary role is important in two respects, first, by pooling together  savings that would have otherwise been fragmented, banks are able to achieve  economies of scale with potential benefit for the users of such funds, secondly  in the absence of banks each person or business seeking credit facilities would  have had to individually look for those with such funds as negotiable with them  directly.<strong></strong></p>
  <h2>Theoretical Framework and Literature Review</h2>
  <p>            Banks occupy a vital position in the  economic life of nation, be it developed or developing. They are the pivot on  which the economy of any nation revolves.<br>
    The word &ldquo;Bank&rdquo; is derived from the  Italian word &ldquo;Banco&rdquo; meaning bench. The laws in Lombardy, the early bankers  conducted their businesses in the market place. (Goshit, 2008). According to  Afolabi (2006), a bank is a financial house established for the purpose of  accepting deposits and other related precious commodities from the public for  safe keeping as well as acting as intermediaries between owners of deposits  funds or lenders and users of the funds.<br>
    On the other hand, Bergrof and  Roland (1995) describes banks as the most entity  in a country&rsquo;s financial system of mobilizing funds. As a result they  constitute the centre piece of the financial system. While Ubom (2009)  describes banks &ldquo;as financial intermediaries that assist in channeling funds  from surplus economic units to deficit one to facilitate business transaction  and economic developments in general.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2>An Overview of the Banking Reforms in Nigeria</h2>
  <p>            This research has utilized reforms  in the banking sector from the 1990s. This is because the 1980s reforms are  outdated for current review. Therefore, prospective banking sector reforms in  Nigeria overtime include the following:</p>
  <h3>The Post SAP  Era (1993)</h3>
  <p>            This era witnessed a brief period  (1993) of renewed regulation (with interest and exchange rates fixed  subsequently, the period of guided deregulation. The deregulation approach to  monetary management and the resultant proliferation of banking and financial  institutions in the early 1990s brought about an increased number of players  far beyond what could be effectively managed by the CBN. As a result, the  financial industry witnessed serious waves of distress that caused crises of  confidence in the industry (Ayanwale 2007). The failed banks (Recovery of  Debts) and financial malpractice in Banks Decree was promulgated in 1994 to  sanitize the banking industry.</p>
  <h3>The Reform  Lethargy (1993 - 1998)</h3>
  <p>            This phase of reform led to the  reduction regulations. During this period the banking sector suffered deep  financial distress, beginning with the civilian democracy in 1999, while it led  to the return to liberalization of the financial sectors, accompanied with the  adoption of distress resolution programmes. This era also saw the introduction  of universal banking which empowered the banks to operate in all aspects of  retail banking and non-banking financial markets (Hancock 1995).</p>
  <h2>Pre Soludu Era  (1999 – 2004)</h2>
  <p>            During this phase of banking  reforms, the number of banks in the economy did not change (i.e. remained at  89). But it was noted that, the number of banks&rsquo; branches increased from 2306  to 3383 (CBN statistical bulletin 2005). The total assets base of banks  increased within this phase from 15.6 billion dollars, 21.9 billion dollars and  24.2 from 2001, 2002 and 2004 billion dollars respectively. The capital and  reserves of banks increase in billions of Naira from 394.6 in 2000 to 821.9 in  2002 and 1060.0 in 2004 (CBN statistical Bulletin 2005).</p>
  <h3>The Soludo Era (2004 – 2005)</h3>
  <p>            The banking sector reforms which  started in 2004 and focused on strengthening and consolidating the banking  system, ended on December 31st 2005 (CBN Briefs 2006 – 2007). The major  emphasis of the reforms on recapitalization and proactive regulation under a  risk-based or risk-focused supervision framework-has ensured competition and  safety of the system and has proactively positioned the industry to perform its  role of intermediation and economic development specifically, the successful  consolidation of the industry has ushered in a number of positive developments  to the banking sector in particular and economy at large (Soludo 2004).<br>
    The  Soludo&rsquo;s banking sector reforms is the most well recognized reform since the  history of the Nigerian banking sector. The nature of these reforms and  outcomes can be categorized under Bank consolidations, Foreign exchange market  stabilization, Interest rate restructuring, and the pursuit of stabilization as  against an inflationary control and Currency control.</p>
  <h3>Post Soludo  (2005 — 2006)</h3>
  <p>After  the Soludo&rsquo;s consolidation, several issues occurred. Following the successful  consolidation of the Nigerian banking industry, a number of consolidation  challenges emerged. These challenges relate to the stake holders in the  industry particularly the operators, regulatory authorities and the government.  In this case operators lost focus; regulators became corrupt and failed in  control, while government also became corrupt and did not monitor.</p>
  <h3>Sanusi Era (2009 – 2012)</h3>
  <p>The CBN  is empowered to regulate both the micro and macro-economic policies on<br>
    behalf of the federal  government and has sweeping authority in financial matters to regulate the  sector and ensure the sustainability in the long run (Sanusi 2010). An  important responsibility of the central bank is to regulate the banking sector  as well as act as the lender of last resort. (CBN 2005)<br>
    On  assumption of office in June 2009, the CBN governor Mallam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi  launched a crusade aimed at sanitizing the banking sector which was at the  verge of collapse going by the result of the joint Audit - inducted by the  banks depositors insurance Scheme (NDIC 2010). Sanusi&rsquo;s crusade was basically  aimed at sanitizing the sector and to streamline the banking industry along the  lines of good corporate governance and internationalizes its practice (Sanusi,  2010).<br>
    The  reforms ensured that banks pay greater attention to the design of their  international process and procedures with respect to risk management. In this  perspective, the asset management initiative was established in order to ensure  that banks operate with international standard. The ACM was an initiative which  was adopted during the period of financial crisis in 2007. The ACM initiative  is basically established in order to improve the capital and liquidity  positions by taking over toxic assets from banks and stimulate bank lending by  equity injection in other to stabilize the banking sector (Sanusi 2010). In a nutshell  Uwu (2010) summarizes the four basic pillars of Mallam Sanusi&rsquo;s reforms to  include ,enhancing the equity of banks, establishing financial stability,  ensuring that the financial sector contributes to the real economy. It is  important to note clearly that since this era is still in process and has to  end part of these reforms have been achieved. The CBN governor, Barro (1991)  held that the reforms in order to achieve its goals must encapsulate a holistic  set of strategies designed to stabilize the banking sector and the economy as a  whole. These strategies include, fixing the problems the banks, tighter  regulation of the banking sector, adoption of a risk based supervision,  effective consumer protection and the reform of the CBN itself.</p>
  <h2>Broad Objectives of Banking Sector Reforms</h2>
  <p>The  literature is replete with studies which show that the objectives of financial,  sector reforms are broadly the same in most countries of sub-Sahara Africa,  Levine and Zervos (1998), CBN (2005) and several financial sector analysts  summarized the objective to include:<br>
    (a)        Less intervention in the market with the  view to promote a more efficient resources allocation.<br>
    (b)        Expending the saving mobilization base  in support of investment and growth through market base interest rates.<br>
    (c)        Improving the regulatory framework and  procedures so as to forestall distress.<br>
    (d)        Laying the basis for minimal  inflationary growth or conclusive enabling environment.<br>
    Among  the policy instruments often employed to attain these objectives are:<br>
    i)          Foreign exchange markets and interest  rates deregulations.<br>
    ii)         Adaptation of market base approach to  credit allocations.<br>
    iii)        Pursuit of sustainable fiscal and  monetary policies</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Reforms  or restructuring of financial markets via legislative changes.</li>
    <li>Active  use of prudential regulations and enforcement of capital adequacy requirements.</li>

  <p>Economic  literature as developed over time states two most basic growth theories that  have been developed since the thirties (Hahn 1964) as cited by Ubom (2009). The  theory that serves as the point of departure in economic survey and the one  that usually receives first consideration in any current discussion of modern  growth theory is one that relates the growth rate of economy&rsquo;s aggregate output  to that of its capital stock. In this approach, capital is the only factor of  production explicitly considered, and it&rsquo;s assumed that labour is determined  with capital in fixed proportions (Shapiro, 1985). <br>
    With  regards to this, the theories in this respect include the classical theories of  economic development and the endogenous growth model. Hence, it is essential to  mobilize domestic and foreign savings in order to generate adequate investment  to accelerate economic growth for an economy to take off<br>
    In this  case the increase in capacity output in Harrod-Domar growth involves a simple  production function that relates the generation of total output to the stock of  capital via the capital output ratio.(Jhinghan 2003) In contrast) the marginal  capital - output ratio ∆K/∆Y tells us how much additional capital to that flow  of output. The marginal ratio need not be equal to the average ratio as long as  technology changes over time.<br>
    Hence,  this theory of growth came into a conclusion that capital output ratio should  borrow and fill the gap between aggregate capital, savings and investment.</p>
  <h2>Correlates of  Economic Reforms and Economic Growth</h2>
  <p>There is  fair agreement in literature that economic reforms, especially what came to be  tagged structural adjustment program (SAP), have almost always been pressured  response to national financial distress whose foundation could be traced to  macroeconomic distortions Levine and Renelt (1992). While such distress  manifest mainly as deep economic problems (stagflation and huge external debts),  distortions are often evident in the pursuit of unsustainable fiscal, monetary  and exchange rate policies in addition to widespread government intervention in  enterprises that can best be handled by the private sector. In general, several  analysts believe that economic mal-adjustment is associated with policy  pursuits which depart from free market pricing policies (Chiber et al, 1986;  Ray, 1986).<br>
    Although  there exist an extensive body of literature on the link between finance sector  development, economic growth and poverty reduction, there is no consensus on  the effects of explanatory variables on economic growth. For example, these  were explained by King and Levine (1993), Levine and Zerves (1998), Rajan and  Zingales (1998) and Levine, Loayza and Beck (1999).<br>
    The  direction of causal relationship between economic growth and banking sector is  one area of contention amongst economists. Schumpeter (1934) for example was a  strong advocate of the role of the banking sector in stimulating economic  growth and stated that &ldquo;the banker stands between those who wish to form new  combinations and the processors of productive means. He is essentially a  phenomenon of development, through only when no central authority directs the  social process. He makes possible the carrying out of new combinations in the  name of exchange economy&rdquo;. Harrison et al (1999) however argue that banking  activities and profitability are functions of economic growth.<br>
    According  to Barvraktar and Wang (2006), banking sector openness had a direct and  indirect effect on economic growth through a combination of improvement in  access to financial services, and the efficiency of financial intermediaries as  both of these causes a lowering of financing which in turn stimulates capital  accumulation and economic growth. Bayraktar and Wang (2004) demonstrated that  the role of foreign banks was both statistically and economically insignificant  in increasing growth and improving the operations of local banks. Guryay et al  (2007) also finds that the effect of financial development or economic growth  of Northern Cyprus although positive was negligible.<br>
    Economics  literature is replete with possible qualitative and quantitative explanatory  variables that influence the growth rate of per capital output overtime Tuuli  (2002) for example, uses the ratio of banks claims on the private sector to  GDP, annual consumer price index, and the interest rate margin to analyze the  relationship between finance and economic growth. The model specified by  Balogun&rsquo;s (2007) theoretical model were more expansive and included money  supply, minimum rediscount rates, private sector credit, ratio of banking  sector credit to government, ratio of stock market capitalization to credit to  the private sector and exchange rates.</p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The study  covered up to two decades and a period of 1990-2010, the pattern and plan of  this research work were based on historical design, as most of the data used  for the study are secondary data which were obtained from CBN bulletin The  available data for credit available to private sector (CPS) and Real Gross  Domestic Product for the period of 1990 - 2010 is presented using table to  facilitate easy understanding. The ordinary least square (OLS) is used for  estimation and tests for analysiss. The research adopted regression equation to  estimate and test for reliability.<br>
    Therefore,  based on this research, the following is formulated as hypothesis for this  research:<br>
    H0:       There is no statistical significance  between credit to private sector and the level of economic growth. </p>
  <h2>Tools of  Analysis</h2>
  <p>The  method of analyzing data was the regression of analysis. Here, the general  regression equation is given as:<br>
    RGDP  =          β0  + β1X1 + ui                    (1)<br>
    RGDP  =          Real  Gross Domestic Product,<br>
    β0             =         Constant Intercepts<br>
    β1         =          Coefficient  of Credit availability to private sector<br>
    X1       =          Annual  credit availability to private sector,<br>
    Ui          =         Disturbance  or Error term.<br>
    The  above regression equation will be estimated using ordinary least square (OLS).  In verifying the result of estimate, the standard error tests, T-test, and the  F – test will be employed for easy verification, interpretation, and testing.  Apart from the model above, the shareholder&rsquo;s fund, assets base and total  deposits immediately after consolidation are also useful criteria for testing  bank performance on economic growth.</p>

  <p>The  Durbin Watson statistics which is used to test for the first order serial  correlation for the error term is given in the table 2 using 0.05 significant  level for the D.W, the dL = 1.221 and du = 1.420 are the upper and  lower limits respectively. For each of the model, there is a problem of the  first order serial correlation of the error term But the adjusted R value for  the double-log model is higher than that of the linear model.<br>
    The  first order serial correlation for the error terms has to be eliminated. When  it is eliminated, the adjusted R value will be reduced. This is the  disadvantage of eliminating the first order serial correlation. So the double  log model with higher R value is used here.<br>
    In  eliminating the first order serial correlation for the error term in the double  log model the dependent and the independent variables in the previous double  log model were transformed to become.<br>
    Log RGDP2=log RGDP  -log I and Log CPS2 = log CPS -log CSPt. XO.588                      (2)<br>
    Where 0.588 is the  correlation between the residual values and the lead residual values.  Therefore, we obtain the equation after double log is conducted to enable  elimination of first order serial correlation.<br>
    RDGP=4.42l+0.1                                        (3)<br>
    T*       = (41.210) (7.962)<br>
    DW-test = (1.689)</p>
  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  <p>As  presented above, coefficient is 4.421 known as constant intercept shows that  the regression line did not pass through the origin. This implies that any  regression line that passes through the origin does implt efficiency. Hence, it  gives the value of RGDP when CP is equal to zero (0), while β1  coefficient is 0.1000, this implies that when the value of (PS increases by one  (l) unit, it would contribute 0.1000 unit to RGDP of the economy which is a  positive figure. Hence, the slope coefficient (CPS) based on the results above  predicts that if CPS increases by one (1) million naira, RGDP will increase by  N100,000. This result shows that the effect of CPS on RGDP is positive.  Therefore from the above analysis one can conclude that CPS as positive effects  on economic growth measured in RGDP of Nigerian economy. The E test shows that  if S.E (is &lt; /2 the explanatory variable under study is a true parameter  Hence, it is statistically significant, from the above if applied. Therefore,  CPS has significant relationship with RGDP.<br>
    R2  value of 0.779, this means 77.9 percent of the variability in the RGDP is  explained by the CPS while the remaining 22 1 percent is caused by other factor  accounted by the error term. The Durbin Watson value finally is 1.689. The new  confidents limits of the DW is D = 1.201 and d = 1.411 since the size of the  sample is 20, DW. (1.689)&gt; d (1.411) we now conclude that there is no first  order serial correlation in the error terms.<br>
    The  F-statistic value (F cal value) is 63.391, testing at 19(df) under 0.05(5%)  level of significance. we obtain the F- tab value as 5.98. since F-cal  &gt;F-tab we reject H and then accept H1 which states that there is  statistical significance between the reforms in the banking sector and the  level of economic growth (RGDP) in Nigeria.<br>
    Since  the t-cal (7 962) &gt; t-tab (2.09), we reject the null hypothesis and  conclude that the CPS coefficient or  paramater is significant. The same is applicable for the constant therefore,  the estimated regression equation is Log RGDPi = 4.421 + 0.100logi  CPSi, I=1 …n. The interpretation is, for every unit  increase in the log of CPS, the log of RGDP increase by 0.1 units.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>In this  study we attempted to measure impact of bank reforms on economic growth in  Nigeria from 1990-2010. More specifically an inquiry was made on how CPS could  lead to more growth of GDP in Nigeria. Based on the methodology adopted for  this study and findings, it is concluded that CPS contributes significantly to  economic growth for the period under study; CPS has the capacity to increase GDP  of the Nigerian economy. But the rate of contribution depends on the amount of  credit given to Private sector in Nigeria. From economic literature other  factors that accounted for the 22.1% may be unavailability of credit, improper  utilization of available credit, among other factors.</p>
  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <p>Based on  the findings of this study, the following recommendations were made so as to  facilitate the effort being made to keep the Nigerian economy on growth path.<br>
    1.         The Nigerian banking sector should  increase the amount of credit given to the private sector; this will in turn  contribute greatly to the growth of GDP bringing about increase in economic  growth of the economy at large.<br>
    2.          This study recommends the need to  strengthen and encourage the existing microfinance banks so that they can serve  the interest and the need of small customers.<br>
    3.         With respect to consolidation, there is  also need to encourage efficiency and prevent consolidation that lead to  situations where excessive risks are generated and most importantly the  consolidation of the entire financial institution.<br>
