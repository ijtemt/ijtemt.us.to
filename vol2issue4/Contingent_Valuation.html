<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>Industrial  area in several developing countries like India experience several levels of  pollution viz. air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution etc. Governments  of such countries allow economic growth at the cost of such pollution. The  cost-benefit analysis plays an important role in order to maintain a balance  between benefit gained from and the cost incurred for the improvement of  environmental quality. To make such an analysis the benefits of improvement of  health quality and life expectancy must be calculated in monetary terms.  Although, remarkable studies are conducted in the developed countries to  estimate the economic value of reducing risks of death and other adverse  effect, yet a few of such studies have been found so far as developing  countries are concerned. Generally the methods for analysis of cost-benefit  approach applicable to developed countries are often taken as the granted  models in the context of developing countries, despite of the difference in  their social, economic, cultural and institutional backgrounds.<br>
  No  doubt large-scale industrialization, modernization, urbanization, population  growth lead to a satisfactory increase in the production of material goods but  generate a significant adverse effects in the different forms of environmental  problems. One of such problems is deterioration of urban air quality. In India  like other developing countries, the levels of air pollution in urban areas  often violate our national air quality standards for several pollutants. There  is a positive association between public mortality and morbidity [1, 2, 3].  Epidemiological studies find a positive relationship between the concentration  of air pollutants and adverse health effects. Air pollution allows some  diseases like asthma, chronic bronchitis, eye irritation, skin disease etc. The  main air pollutants are Suspended Particular Matter ( SPM ), especially  Respirable Suspended Particular Matter ( RSPM/PM10 ), nitrogen  Oxides ( NOx ), sulpher dioxide ( SO2). Hence, our government  essentially require updating information about the costs and benefits related  with the reduce levels of pollution to implement the policy control measures.  Industrial&rsquo;s utility depends on air quality and there exits an economic value  of it. There are several method to measure the economic value of air quality  viz. Dose-response approach, production function approach, revealed preference  approach etc. In dose-response approach, it assumes a technical relationship  between air quality and morbidity ( and/or mortality ) [ 2, 4]. It puts a price  tag on air quality without retrieving people&rsquo;s preferences for the good. The  revealed preference approach assumes that the consumers are aware of the  costs/benefits of air quality and accordingly they are able to adjust their  locations to reveal their preferences. It is also assumed that the markets are  perfects and consumers are perfectly informed in [ 5 ]. The health production  function approach estimates the economic benefits from reduced morbidity due to  reduction in air pollution. The household health production function and the  demand function for mitigating activities are implicit in the utility  maximization of an individual excluding non-use value of environmental amenity.  In developing countries like India, markets are imperfect and consumers are not  perfectly informed. Moreover, the above mentioned approaches do not incorporate  the non-use values ( passive use values/existence values ) of the environmental  good/service to estimate the total economic value ( use value + non-use value )  of it. Therefore to find out the economic value of an environmental amenity in  demand assessment studies in the developing countries like India, Contingent  Valuation Method ( C V M ) is more appropriate and widely used by the  researchers in [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]. In this paper CVM is used to estimate the  economic value on improving air quality in Asansol zone of West Bengal. It is  an effort to estimate the residenets&rsquo; WTP to improve the air quality in the  industrial areas of West Bengal, India. At the same time this exercise also  helps us to find out the present attitude of the residents&rsquo; in the industrial  zone towards environmental quality improvement and encourage the application of  CVM in India. The rest of the paper describes the work in the following order:<br>
  <strong>       section 2</strong> provides a brief discussion on the  literature review on CVM;<strong> section 3</strong> describes a brief history of our  survey area; <strong>section 4</strong> makes a describtion of our survey format and  questionnaire design; <strong>section 5 </strong>discusses the methodology used in this  article; <strong>section 6</strong> contains the descriptive statistics of variables used  in our estimation and the econometric analysis of the determinants of WTP  function, based on which maximum WTP can be determined; <strong>section 7</strong> ends  with conclusions and suggests some policy implications.</p>
<h1>Literature  Review on CVM</h1>
<p>    Air quality like other  public good, non-marketed good/service face quantity rather than a price  constraint. In developing countries like India, air quality can be treated as a  luxury item which can be afforded only when adequate food, clothing and shelter  are acquired. Therefore income effects due to a change in air quality provision  undermines the consumer surplus of welfare changes. Hicksian compensating  surplus ( CS ) ( i.e. the maximum WTP to ensure the improvement is occurred )  and equivalent surplus ( ES ) [ i.e. minimum WTA if the improvement does not  occur ] could be used to measure the change in the level of welfare in quantity  constrained utility function. Individuals WTP for improved air quality can be  expressed in monetary terms with the help of consumers&rsquo; preferences. Consumer  preferences can be expressed either using revealed or stated preference data.  The 1st approach is based on the past experiences of the consumers&rsquo; whereas in  latter, the economic value placed by an individual for a non-marketed  good/service is contingent upon a hypothetical scenario i.e. presented to the  respondents for valuing where in the hypothetical market the good/service can  be traded. The contingent market can be defined as the market in which both the  good is provided and the way it is financed. Hence we consider the maximum WTP  for the good/service by the corresponding respondents. Since the elicited WTP  values are contingent upon the particular hypothetical market describes to the  respondents, this approach is to be called CVM. In CVM maximum WTP are asked to  the respondents and that can be derived in several ways:<br>
  <strong>Open Ended Question Format </strong>CV studies use open  ended question format: The respondents are asked for their maximum WTP but no  value being offered to them. The individuals have often found difficulties to  answer such questions, especially where they have no previous experience of  trading with the commodity in question. Least square regression is used to  estimate the WTP under open-ended CVM. <strong>Closed Ended Referendum Question  Format--</strong> A single payment is offered to which respondents may agree or  disagree [ Yes/No reply ]. Such responses are known as &lsquo;<strong>dichotomous choice</strong>&rsquo;  ( DC) responses. As compare with other it is difficult because analyst is  unable to know a particular sum ( offer-price ) that cannot be revealed through  respondents&rsquo; WTP. But it is advantageous for the respondent to consider the  suggested price option, particularly in case of non-marketed goods. Another  important reason for using closed ended format is that strategic biases in the  responses can be better controlled. Their binary forms of dichotomous choice  adopts a random utility function. In this case, the coefficient values can be  estimated by using a binary logit or probit model by applying the maximum  likelihood method. The <strong>NOAA</strong> ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  ) experts panels in 1993 [ 11 ] came out strongly in favour of using  Dichotomous choice questions. Again in <strong>double-bounded referendum question  format</strong> present those respondents who say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to the first amount with a  lower amount and those respondents who say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the first amount with a  higher amount. Another option is to apply a <strong>payment card voter referendum</strong> or<strong> sequential referendum method</strong> in which a range of values on a card is  presented that indicates the typical expenditure by the respondents for a given  income-group or other publicly provided services. In this method the respondent  gets the opportunity to vote on a single offer amount. The respondent is asked  to indicate the maximum WTP from an ordered set of values say ranging from &lsquo;0&rsquo; to  &lsquo;B&rsquo; or more. This approach undoubtedly increase the valuation efficiency but  simultaneously arises a greater difficulty in the estimation of distribution  and endogeneity problem in the follow-up question as well. In CV literature  parametric or non-parametric techniques are often used in the estimation of the  distribution of WTP function. Non-parametric estimations are nothing but a set  of techniques which can be applied to estimate a WTP function to find out its  mean and median without assuming its nature of WTP data and that can be  obtained by doing simplest numerical calculation.  The main disadvantage of non-parametric  approximation is that it does not allow a conditional analysis.  Another estimation of the distribution of WTP  function is carried out in the literature with parametric techniques. In this  approximation the analyst assumes that a WTP function is distributed in the  population according to some probability distribution. Once a probability  distribution is chosen the researcher can be able to estimate the parameter of  the model. Once a parametric model of WTP has been estimated mean, median of  WTP can be calculated. A parametric model represents the relationship between  the WTP and the consumers&rsquo; intrinsic characteristics. The main advantages of  the parametric model are that it is relatively easy to impose preference axioms  combine experiments and extrapolate the calculations to different population  without constraining exclusively to the sampled population in [ 12 ]. In our  case study we would like to apply the logit model to estimate the parameters of  the WTP function. Literature on CVM mainly focused on the conditional analysis  of WTP. In this case our main goal is to find out the conditional relation of  WTP and its determining factor ( say &lsquo;X&rsquo; ) which describes consumers&rsquo;  characteristics. CVMs are used in different grounds mostly in developed  countries. But so far the developing countries are concerned, only a few  attempts are taken in using CVM. In developing countries CVM is used in two major  fields–water supply and sanitation in [ 13, 14, 15 ]; tourism recreation,  heritage and National Parks in [ 16, 17, 18 ]; water quality [ 19 ]; health in  [ 20, 21, 22 ]; social forestry in [ 23 ] and telecom services in rural areas  in [ 12 ]. Main notable works on CVM used in this area of air quality  measurement can be stated here are–one in Beijing, China [ 9 ]. Their main  objective is to estimate and assess WTP to improve air quality in the urban  area of Beijing. Their mean WTP for a 50% reduction of harmful substances in  the air was 143CNY per household per year; and total WTP at the resident in the  study area was 336 million CNY per year. The mean WTP expressed as a proportion  of household annual income was amounted to 0.7%. In India Kumar estimated WTP for  air quality improvement at Panipath Thermal Power Station ( PTPS ) colony,  Panipath, Hariyana, India [ 10 ], with the help of CVM. They found that health  status and bid values are two important factors in determining WTP function.  Their results revealed that people in PTPS colony were WTP about 2% of their  monthly income for an improvement of their air quality programme. Whereas,  Professor James K. Hammitt [ 24 ] related the economic value of presenting  adverse health effects to air pollution in three different locations ( Beijing,  Anquing and rural areas surrounding Anquing ) in China. They include 3  different end points: colds, chronic bronchitis and fatality. Their data were  mainly used to investigate the relationship between WTP to reduce health risk  and air quality. By using CVM their sample average median WTP lies between US$  500 and US$1,000 to prevent chronic bronchitis. The value per statistical life  ranges between US$4,000 and US$17,000 and value of median WTP to prevent cold  range between US$ 3 and US$ 6. Estimated mean values are between 2 and 13 times  larger to prevent fatality.</p>
<h1>A  Brief History of the Survey Area</h1>
<p>Asansol  is an important city in Bardhaman district of West Bengal, India. We shall  discuss the development of Asansol from different angles as follows:<br>
  <strong><em>A.      Asansol Administration</em></strong><br>
  In  1906, Asansol became as the subdivision of Bardhaman. In 1910, there were five  police stations viz. Asansol, Raniganj, Kanska, Faridpur and Barakar. After the  change in 2006, the Asansol subdivision was constituted with Chittaranjan,  Salanpur, Baraboni, Asansol ( North ), Asansol ( South ), Raniganj, Jamuria,  Hirapur and Kulti police stations. For looking after the civic needs at Asansol  a union committee was formed in 1850. Although the Asansol municipality was  approved in 1885, but it started its function in 1886. In 1991 Asansol was  upgraded to the status of a corporation. The corporation situated between two  rivers— Damodar and Ajay. Another river Barakar joins the Damodar near  Dishergarh. Dhanbad district of Jharkhand is on the western side while Durgapur  subdivision of Bardhaman district of West Bengal is on the eastern side of  Asansol. To the south across the Damodar river are Purulia and Bankura district  whereas Dumka and Bhirbhum district are on the north side of Asansol.</p>

<p><strong><em>B.        Agriculture in Asansol</em></strong><br>
  <strong></strong>    Agriculture is one of the other main industries in Asansol. The main  crops  grown in and around Asansol is the  rice which is the principal food of this region. Other commonly grown crops are  pulses, oil seeds, wheats, potatoes and variety of different types of green  vegetables.<br>
  <strong><em>C.        </em></strong><strong>Industries in Asansol</strong><br>
  <strong>          </strong>As the second largest city in West  Bengal, Asansol is known for being the &lsquo;coal mining city&rsquo; as the entire region  of Asansol sits on layers and layers of coal. The coal is of high quality  superior coal. Although economy of Asansol is based on the coal industries, yet  there are some other important industries have also developed. Some of them  are: Indian Iron and Steel Company ( IISCO ), Burnpur Cement Limited ( BCL ),  Dishergarh Power Supply Company limited, Joy Balaji Sponge Iron Private  Limited, Shyam Gel Limited ( Power Divisions ) etc. In Asansol the ambient air  quality has rapidly deteriorated due to mainly for industrialization,  modernization and urbanization. In 2010 the total population in Asansol is  486304 (as per as 2001 census). 53% of this population are male and the rest  i.e. 47% are female. 73% of total population of Asansol are literate which is  higher than the national average of 59.9%. 57% of male and 43% of female are  literate. The number of vehicles are also arising. In our survey area  industrialization and transport vehicles are two major sources of pollutants.  Table-I shows the ambient pollutant levels– Nitrogen Dioxide ( NO2 ), Carbon Monoxide ( CO )  and particulate matters less that 10 μg ( PM10  ) was violating the National Ambient Air Pollution Control Board for the  residential areas since Indian coal has high contain of ash. That is why we can  say that the widespread critically of PM10 is the main cause of  deteriorating air quality and the households living in the industrial belts are  suffering due to air pollution.</p>

<h1>Survey  Format and Questionnaire Design</h1>
<p>The  survey was conducted from August, 2009 in Asansol and carried out up to May,  2010. CV was conducted in persons for 242 households. In our survey study  questions are asked to the respondents in face-to-face interview rather than  telephonic conversation or mail survey [ 11 ] recommended in person&rsquo;s interview  as compared with the other two methods to achieve contingent values. The  questionnaire was pretested through a series of selected group interviews  conducted in the field. The pretested survey helped us to design the final  questionnaire in such a fashion so that questionnaire was logistically sound  and the WTP questions were easily understood by the respondents.<br>
  The  final questionnaire consisted of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Demographic Features,</li>
  <li>Monthly Income,</li>
  <li>Health Stock Measures,</li>
  <li>Expenses for Medical  Treatment,</li>
  <li>Question Connected with  Environmental Awareness,</li>
  <li>Contingent Valuation  Questions ( the WTP of the respondent to improve the air quality in  Asansol  ).</li>
</ul>
<p>    In the first part of  questionnaire design the respondents are faced six questions and they are: Age,  Gender, Marital status, Residential area, Educational background and  Occupation. In our sample a small portion of respondents&rsquo; are belonging to  rural background. Most members of the sample are married persons. Monthly  income is considered here as the total income from salary ( if any ) and other  source of incomes ( viz. income from rent, interest received from the savings,  income from business, agriculture etc. ). The third category of questions is  related to health stock measures where health is a multidimensional rather than  one dimensional variable. In our survey health stock contains three types of  variables (a) health status ( whether health is excellent, very good, good and  poor ), (b) existence of diseases and if yes its name and (c) duration of  diseases in case of chronic diseases and its name. The fourth category is  related with the question of expenses for medical treatment. The respondents is  asked whether a doctor usually visit during a month, if yes, the number of  month visits. In the next part the environmental awareness questions are set to  understand the general attitude and awareness of the respondents. The question  related with it are: (a) environmental awareness ( highly aware, aware,  awareness to some extent, totally ignorant ); (b) causes of the above stated  diseases, if any (pollution related, lack of proper facility, excessive work  load, any other); and (c) the adoption of any environmental safety measures  with a yes/no type question. In the last section of the questionnaire the  respondents are asked CV questions in the form of dichotomous question format.  A particular bid value is offered to a single respondent and he/she has two  options either to agree or disagree corresponding to this bid value for  improved air quality. At the same time we remind the respondents that they have  less amount of money available for the expenditure on other necessary as well  as luxury items, if he/she is willing to pay the amount for the improvement of  the air quality, although nothing is changed at present. Here we use different  photographs, blue prints etc. to make understand CV questions to the  respondents. With this extra revenue earned by the government, they can use by  purchasing equipments for pollution control and make it mandatory to the  company to use them. At the same time, less pollution created modern vehicles  and motors can be provided by the government to reduce the deteriorating air  quality generated by the motor vehicles. At the same we take care of the  duration of time for each interview. Because if interview is lengthy, the  interviewee may become bored and lose patience with answering the question.  Again if an interview is too short, the interviewee may not have enough time to  understand the information provided and think carefully about their answers. In  the 'pre-test' survey, length of the interview was tested and accordingly the  interview was limited to about 15--20 minutes. When we state about the WTP for  improved air quality, it implicitly includes the value of several benefits from  reduction in damage costs like the avoidance of diseases due to air pollution  along with their related costs ( lost of working hours, lost of leisure time,  expenditure on defensive behaviour and treatment cost as well ). At the same  time when the respondents are WTP for improved air quality, they are ready to  sacrifice some other uses of their present income. The respondent was made  aware of these aspects in creating the appropriate hypothetical market. The  respondents are also awaken against free riding, as the good to be valued was a  public good. As CVM is not free from criticism and suffering from different  biases, we have tried our best to minimize these biases. To minimum  hypothetical bias at the time of interview we reminded the respondent that they  have limited income which has alternative uses. If they agree to pay for the  improvement of air quality they would have less money for expenditure. To avoid  anchoring bias we offer those 'bid' values in our final survey which are  selected on the basis of the information gathered from our pilot survey. So far  as embeddedness is concerned we clearly mentioned that the respondents are  asked to express their maximum WTP for getting better air quality in Asansol  zone only and not for other places. In order to reduce strategic bias we take  those observations in our final survey which are consistent with their  corresponding income, education level, awareness about environment, health  status etc. Other inconsistent observations ( may create outliers ) are dropped  from our final sample. In case of open-ended and bidding game elicitation  format possibilities of anchoring bias and strategic bias will be high. We  therefore are not interested to apply them in our CVM execution. Again payment  card elicitation format is very difficult to apply in case of heterogeneous  income group and it is not very much popular. That's why in our case study we  choose single bounded dichotomous choice ( DC )type of question format. Our  pilot survey had also revealed that majority people accept monthly reduction  through electricity bill as a mode of payment vehicle. </p>
<h1>methodology</h1>
<p>In  our case study we adopt single bounded DC type of question elicitation format.  A particular bid value 'B' offered to a respondent. The response may be either  'yes' or 'no'. That is our dependent variable can take only two values: '1' for  yes and '0' for no. That's why it is called a binary dichotomous variable. If  the response is 'yes' then the investigator knows B ≤ max. WTP, if 'no' then <img src="Contingent_Valuation_clip_image002.gif" alt="A Contingent Valuation Approach to Estimate the Maximum Willingness-to-pay for Improved Air Quality in Asansol, Industrial Area of West Bengal" width="103" height="18"> But the drawback  of the format is that no concrete information is available to pin down the  exact  value of max. WTP. In spite of  that limitation we adopt this method as it provides the best results against  stragegic bias. But in estimation procedure partial observability possesses a  serious constraints. The problem in this regard is that although respondent can  fully recognized his/her preferences through the utility function but  researcher can observe only a part. That's why consumers' utility function can  be split up into two parts –(I) an observable deterministic component and (II)  unobservable random error term. Therefore a <strong>Random Utility Model ( RUM )</strong> is chosen to represent the choice decision where the only objective is to find  out the probability of 'yes' response to a bid. It can be derived by applying  logit or probit estimation. In our case study we assume that the error term  follows the logistic distribution and the probability of saying 'yes' response  can be totally explained in terms of our given households' characteristics.  Therefore it is rational to apply conditional logit regression [ 25]. The model used in our  study is briefly given below:<br>
  Uh = Uh(Xh,Q0);  h = 1, 2, · · ·N,where<br>
  Uh  : utility of the &lsquo;h&rsquo;th household,                                        <br>
  Xh: An  N×1 vector of the private goods <br>
  consumed by  the h-th household,<br>
  Q0: Air  quality, an environmental amenity <br>
  ( an  non-marketed good ).<br>
  Therefore, the individual&rsquo;s problem  becomes:<br>
  <strong>Max.:</strong>  U = Uh(Xh,Q0)  · · · · · · · · · ( 1 )<br>
  <strong>Subject to:</strong> a fixed income M and vector prices for all other  goods and services and  exogenously  determined level of the environmental good Q0.<br>
  Mathematically, the maximization problem  can be stated as–<br>
  <img src="Contingent_Valuation_clip_image004.gif" alt="A Contingent Valuation Approach to Estimate the Maximum Willingness-to-pay for Improved Air Quality in Asansol, Industrial Area of West Bengal" width="39" height="36">Uh(Xh,Q0) | M ≥ PX; Q0  is preassigned ].<br>
  The <strong>&lsquo;dual&rsquo;</strong> to the problem of  utility maximization is cost minimization.   Therefore, the dual problem becomes-<br>
  <strong>Minimize: </strong>expenditures<br>
  <strong>subject  to:</strong> a  constraint of fixed level of utility and  <br>
  environmental good/service.<br>
  <strong>Mathematically</strong>,<br>
  e(P,Q0,U) =<img src="Contingent_Valuation_clip_image006.gif" alt="A Contingent Valuation Approach to Estimate the Maximum Willingness-to-pay for Improved Air Quality in Asansol, Industrial Area of West Bengal" width="35" height="36">[PX | U ≤ U(X,Q0); Q0 is preassigned] · · <br>
  · · · · · · (2)<br>
  where e(P,Q0,U) is the expenditure function.<br>
  And the minimum expenditure is necessary  to achieve the fixed level of utility U, dependent on prices and the level of  Q. <br>
  Hence, WTP  = WQ = −<img src="Contingent_Valuation_clip_image008.gif" alt="A Contingent Valuation Approach to Estimate the Maximum Willingness-to-pay for Improved Air Quality in Asansol, Industrial Area of West Bengal" width="97" height="42">· · · · · · · · · (3),  where WQ is the reduction in the income i. e. sufficient to maintain  utility at its level corresponding to no improvement in the air quality. The  maximum WTP for an improvement of the air quality can be expressed in terms of  compensating surplus ( CS ) for measuring the welfare change by using  expenditure function that can be stated as follows:<br>
  WTP = e(P,Q1,U,  Sh) − e(P,Q0,U, Sh) · · · · · · · · · ( 4 ), i.e.  the difference between the two levels of minimum expenditure to achieve fixed utility U , where Q1 ≥ Q0 ; P is the price vector, Sh is the vector  of socio-economic characteristics of the h-th household. If the reference  utility is the utility that household gets with polluted air, then it is the  difference in the minimum expenditure required the household to be as well off  with the unpolluted air as it was with polluted air. Given the equation ( 4 ),  if the h-th household will say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to a specific bid value '<strong>B'</strong>  if WTP(P, Q1  , Q0 , U , Sh  ) ≥ B · · · · · · · · · ( 5 ) and &lsquo;no&rsquo; otherwise.<br>
  The probability P of accepting the bid  related to the air quality Q will be P(Yes) = P( B − WTP &lt; ε ) · · · · · · ·  · · ( 6 ), where &lsquo;ε&rsquo; is the unobserved random component of WTP                                                                     function.  It could be logistically or standard normally distributed. If &lsquo;ε&rsquo; is assumed to  be distributed logistically it becomes a logit model.<br>
  The probability of an affirmative  response to the bid value &lsquo;B&rsquo;, where the household has a vector X of  explanatory variable is <br>
  P(Yes/X) = <img src="Contingent_Valuation_clip_image010.gif" alt="A Contingent Valuation Approach to Estimate the Maximum Willingness-to-pay for Improved Air Quality in Asansol, Industrial Area of West Bengal" width="54" height="43">  · · · · · · · · · ( 7 ).<br>
  Maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) can  be applied to estimate the logit model. <br>
  Once the logit model is estimated, the  cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) can be identified by these estimated  parameters. For the logit model due   Hanemann [ 26, 27 ] and  Vaughan [  28 ] provided the WTP formula for the unrestricted expected values, the median  and truncated expected value that restricts WTP to be positive.</p>

<h1>Descriptive  Statistics of Variables Used in our Estimation   and econometric analysis of the determinants of wtp function</h1>
<p>          The survey uses data obtained from  242 interviews in Asansol zone of West Bengal in India. To find out consistent  parameters, this exercise applies non-linear estimation method the logit model  which includes the random sampling. Every respondent was asked whether he or  she is willing to pay a particular bid value. That means he has only two  options either agree or disagree against a particular bid value. In this case  the discrete dependent variable takes the value 1 if the bid is accepted by the  respondent, otherwise, it takes the value 0. The data entering method includes  the problems of correlation among the errors of each household. This kind of  problem can be overcome with a straight forward procedure consistent with the  bootstrapping literature. Two categories of run can be applied here. One is the  point estimates of the parameters from a model can be estimated that used all  the data. To estimate the true z-statistic of these estimates, one observation  was chosen randomly from every group of observation for each household and thereby  helped to reduce the sample to the number of respondents. This procedure was  followed 8 times; the reported values for the z-statistics depend on the  average values of z-statistics from these 8 runs. The table III provides the  necessary descriptive statistics and definitions of major variables. The  estimated parameters of the logit model are expressed in terms of table IV.  Table IV shows that so far as the demographic variables are concerned, some of  them have significant influence on WTP and they are households' income, status  of occupation and existence of diseases. WTP rises with the rise in income,  occupational status and existence of diseases. The WTP of residents also have  positive relationship with environmental awareness of the respondents. As the value  of environmental awareness increases the WTP decreases, in our questionnaire it  is a self reporting index ranges from 1-- 4. For this result the coefficient of  environmental awareness is negative. Table IV also shows that the adoption of  safety measures against pollution is highly significant and it has a direct  relationship with WTP. Again, table IV reveals that the two parameters health  status and bid value are statistically significant. The coefficient of health  status is positive and statistically different from zero at 0.05 level. As  health status is a self reporting index ranging from 1- 4, the respondents  indicates the value 1 if they have excellent health status and the value  increases as the quality of health status decreases. This means that the  probability of acceptance of higher bid value is positively related with the  decrease in the self reported health status. The coefficient of the bid value  is negative and statistically significant at the 0.01 level. This implies that  probability of acceptance of the bid is inversely related with the bid value.  The lower the value of the bid the higher will be the probability of  acceptance. It is difficult to compare the results obtained in the study with  the previous ones since the CVM has been rarely applied in India. The main  objective of this study is to use CVM for the estimation of the maximum WTP of  the respondents of Asansol zone of West Bengal ( an  industrial belt ) in India for their improved  air quality. Table V reports the estimates of households WTP in our survey  area. In this case we use Hanemanns formulae to find out WTP estimates for the  untruncated mean, median, the mean truncated at zero but untruncated from above  but the truncated mean lies between zero and maximum bid value. The expected  WTP varies between Rs. 66.47 per month per household ( untruncated mean/median  ) to Rs 89.56 per month per household ( between zero and maximum bid value ).  The expected mean/average value of WTP is Rs.78.87 per month per household when  the mean is truncated at zero but untruncated from the above mean. The  variation of benefits expresses the fact that we cannot conclude a single  number which represents WTP of the respondents for the improvement of the air  quality. But the net benefits of improved air quality remain positive  irrespective of the measure of the central tendency. Although the income of the  people of survey area is less as compare with that of developed countries, they  are aware of the environmental pollution. They are also conscious to protect  our environment from pollution. The main reasons for not paying are as follows:  willing but have poor income (37.25% respondents not WTP), less important issue  compare to other seriour problems (17.38%), government should pay (15.17%),  polluting industries should pay (21.32%), rich section should pay (06.78%) and  others (02.1%). the main reasons for paying are: to aviod illness episodes  (37.33% respondents WTP), duty to protect our enviornment (30.14%), protection  required for the future generation and/or for future use (31.6%), payment  should be mendatory (0.93%).</p>

<h1>Conclusion and policy implication</h1>
<p>          In this exercise  our objective is to apply CVM to estimate maximum WTP of the respondents in  Asansol zone of West Bengal, India ( an industrial belt ) for their improved  air quality in monetary terms. In this way, we make an attempt to verify the  economic rationale of air quality preservation. The benefits of the respondents  in our study area are estimated and estimates ranges from Rs.66.47 per month to  Rs 89.56 per month per household for untruncated mean/median to truncated mean.  Although the use of CVM in the valuation of environmental goods and services in  India is rare, we are optimistic about the potential application of this  method. Our study suggests that the use of CVM in developing countries like  India can be both practical, feasible, logical as well as reliable data could  be obtained via proper questionnaire design and survey execution. Although more  studies are required on CVM to get comparable data and better practice in  India. But we are still doubtful to measure the accurate benefits of the  environmental improvement due to the existence of uncertainty, yet this study  concludes with the remark that CVM is a useful and flexible technique for the  planners and policy makers in their decision making. But it should be note  worthy to mention that each particular CV format must depend on the situation and  the location, so that proper and successful estimated value of the  environmental amenity can be attained. Moreover, this analysis ensures a fact  that the respondents in our study area are well conscious about the air  pollution problems. They think that they have lost valuation of health benefits  because of the air pollution and accordingly they are willing to pay for the  improvement of the air quality. Our hope is that this work provides important  policy relevant information for enhancing air pollution abatement investment in  the Asansol zone of west Bengal in India. Thus the findings of our study  support our received wisdom 'protect now, before it is too late'.</p>
