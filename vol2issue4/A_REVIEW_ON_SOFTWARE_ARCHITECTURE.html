Paper Title :<br>A REVIEW ON SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Software Architecture is a sub discipline of Software Engineering. The term software architecture intuitively denotes the high level structures of a software system. It can be defined as the set of structures needed to reason about the software system, which comprise the software elements, the relations between them, and the properties of both elements and relations. The term software architecture also denotes the set of practices used to select, define or design a software architecture. Finally, the term often denotes the documentation of a system's "software architecture". Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about the high-level design, and allows reuse of design components between projects.

  <p><em>Abstract</em>— Software  Architecture is a sub discipline of Software Engineering. The term software architecture  intuitively denotes the high level structures of a software system. It can be  defined as the set of structures needed to reason about the software system,  which comprise the software elements, the relations between them, and the  properties of both elements and relations. The term software architecture also  denotes the set of practices used to select, define or design a software  architecture. Finally, the term often denotes the documentation of a system's  &quot;software architecture&quot;. Documenting software architecture  facilitates communication between stakeholders, captures early decisions about  the high-level design, and allows reuse of design components between projects.<br>
    Keywords-Software  Architecture; Components; Characteristics (key words)</p>
  <h1> Introduction          </h1>
  <p>To  date there is still no agreement on the precise definition of software  architecture. Opinions vary as to what is architectural in the software world  like:<br>
    i.  Overall, macroscopic system structure; this refers to architecture as a higher  level abstraction of a software system that consists of high-level components  and connectors, as opposed to implementation details. <br>
    ii.  The important stuff - whatever that is; this refers to the fact that software  architects should concern themselves with those decisions that have high impact  on the system and its stakeholders—which may include apparently low-level  details. <br>
    iii.  That which is fundamental to understanding a system in its environment.<br>
    iv.  Things that people perceive as hard to change; since designing the architecture  takes place at the beginning of a software system's lifecycle, the architect  should focus on decisions that &ldquo;have to&rdquo; be right the first time, since  reversing such decisions may be impossible or prohibitively expensive. <br>
    v.  A set of architectural design decisions; software architecture should not be  considered merely a set of models or structures, but should include the  decisions that lead to these particular structures, and the rationale behind  them. This insight has led to substantial research into software architecture  knowledge management.<br>
    There is no sharp distinction between software architecture versus  design and requirements engineering. They are all part of a &ldquo;chain of  intentionality&rdquo; from high-level intentions to low-level details..</p>
  <h1>Software architecture characteristics</h1>
  <p>Software architecture exhibits the  following characteristics. <br>
    i. <strong>Multitude of stakeholders:</strong> Software systems  have to cater to a variety of stakeholders such as business managers, owners,  users and operators. These stakeholders all have their own concerns with  respect to the system. Balancing these concerns and demonstrating how they are  addressed is part of designing the system. This implies that architecture  involves dealing with a broad variety of concerns and stakeholders, and has a  multidisciplinary nature.<br>
    ii. <strong>Separation of concerns:</strong> The established way  for architects to reduce complexity is by separating the concerns that drive  the design. Architecture documentation shows that all stakeholder concerns are  addressed by modelling and describing the architecture from separate points of  view associated with the various stakeholder concerns. These separate  descriptions are called architectural views.<br>
    iii. <strong>Quality-driven:</strong> Classical software design  approaches like the Jackson Structured Programming were driven by required  functionality and the flow of data through the system, but the current insight  is that the architecture of a software system is more closely related to its  quality attributes such as fault-tolerance, backward compatibility,  extensibility, reliability, maintainability, availability, security, usability,  and other such – ilities. Stakeholder concerns often translate into  requirements on these quality attributes, which are variously called non-functional  requirements, extra-functional requirements, system quality requirements or  constraints.<br>
    iv. <strong>Recurring styles:</strong> Like building  architecture, the software architecture discipline has developed standard ways  to address recurring concerns. These &ldquo;standard ways&rdquo; are called by various  names at various levels of abstraction. Common terms for recurring solutions  are architectural style, strategy or tactic, reference architecture and  architectural pattern.<br>
    v. <strong>Conceptual Integrity:</strong> A term introduced by  Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month to denote the idea that the architecture  of a software system represents an overall vision of what it should do and how  it should do it. This vision should be separated from its implementation. The  architect assumes the role of &ldquo;keeper of the vision&rdquo;, making sure that  additions to the system are in line with the architecture, hence preserving  conceptual integrity.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Defines Structure</h1>
  <p>A lot of time of any software architect gets into how  to partition any particular application into different coherent sets of  interrelated components, modules, objects or any other unit of software  partitioning. The architecture of the resulting software must be kept in mind  at all the times, that, what are functionalities that the software promises to  provide in the future, how the resultant software will be better, efficient and  error free.<br>
    Take an example: An organization has a software  requirement which takes in the data from various web servers across the globe.  This data has then to be compiled to form metadata at one final destination.  This compiled data implies some information and this information finally  developed has to provide the next task for all the web server managers across  the globe. This task is repeated in that particular organization every day.  Such kind of data interchanging and data implications lead to various kinds of  constraints like; structural and functional constraints. Other important  factors include application update in one place at one time, multiple web server  dependency may lead to violation of ACID property of database. So all these  factors have to be kept in mind while the application is in the development  phase and modules are created for the development. It is the responsibility of  the software architect to analyse all such future constraints and assign  responsibilities to each constituent component. In partitioning an application,  the architect assigns responsibilities to each constituent component. These  responsibilities define the tasks a component can be relied upon to perform  within the application.<br>
    By using the above mentioned method it is  ensured that each component plays a specific role in the application, and the  overall component ensemble that comprises the architecture collaborates to  provide the required functionality. Responsibility-driven design is a technique  from object-orientation that can be used effectively to help define the key  components in any architecture. It provides a method based on informal tools  and techniques that emphasize architectural and behavioral modelling using  objects, responsibilities and collaborations. A key structural issue for nearly  all applications is minimizing dependencies between building blocks or modules  a.k.a. components, creating as much loosely coupled architecture as possible  from a set of highly cohesive components. Such modules ensure that the change  in one module does not induce a change in the other module and hence these  modules are secure to be worked upon and worked with. But when the change in one  module or component induces a change in other one it is said to be a  dependency. By removing unnecessary dependencies, changes are not propagated  throughout the architecture <br>
    <img src="A_REVIEW_ON_SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE_clip_image002.gif" alt="REVIEW ON SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE" width="336" height="206"> <br>
    Fig 1.2: Different types of component/module  dependencies.<br>
    Excessive dependencies pose a big problem when it  comes to creating a good architecture as the future change in an implied module  will lead to a change in most of the implying module. So, excessive dependency  makes it difficult, expensive, erroneous, tedious and time-consuming to make  changes to system.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Specifies Component Communication</h1>
  <p>Whenever the development phase of any software is  going on, it is divided into modules as discussed already. This division into  modules, makes the individual module dataflow and communication flow a  difficult issue. Therefore it has to be seen that the modules can communicate  with each other at the required point of time. As well as the dataflow in  between the modules has to be taken care of. If the modules can communicate  between each other and transfer data amongst each other at all points of time  after the development of the software, the development is said to be a success. <br>
    To carry out such communication and data flow between  modules, several types of methods can be used like: They may execute in  different threads or processes, and communicate through synchronization  mechanisms. Or multiple components may need to be simultaneously informed when  an event occurs in the application&rsquo;s environment. There are many other  possibilities as well. Discussing further about communication and data flow  between modules, it can be said that a particular class of development takes  care of it. This particular class of software is called &ldquo;architectural  patterns&rdquo; or &ldquo;architectural styles&rdquo;. These patterns are essentially reusable  architectural blueprints that describe the structure and interaction between  collections of participating components. Each pattern has well-known  characteristics that make it appropriate to use in satisfying particular types  of requirements. For example, the client–server pattern has several useful  characteristics, such as synchronous request–reply communications from client  to server, and servers supporting one or more clients through a published  interface. Optionally, clients may establish sessions with servers, which may  maintain state about their connected clients. Client–server architectures must  also provide a mechanism for clients to locate servers, handle errors, and  optionally provide security on server access. All these issues are addressed in  the client–server architecture pattern.<br>
    The power of patterns comes from the development  objectives, utility, robustness, ability to convey design information as well  as data information within the components / modules. Patterns are proven to  work. If used appropriately in an architecture, you leverage existing design  knowledge by using patterns. Large systems tend to use multiple patterns,  combined in ways that satisfy the architecture requirements. When an  architecture is based around patterns, it also becomes easy for team members to  understand a design, as the pattern infers component structure, communications  and abstract mechanisms that must be provided. When someone tells me their  system is based on a three-tier client–server architecture, I know immediately  a considerable amount about their design. This is a very powerful communication  mechanism indeed.</p>
  <h1>Architecture Addresses Nonfunctional Requirements</h1>
  <p>Nonfunctional requirements are those requirements  which don&rsquo;t appear in use cases. They are always concerned with how the  application provides the required functionality. There are three distinct areas  of nonfunctional requirements:<br>
    a. Technical constraints: They constrain design  options by specifying certain technologies that the application must use. &ldquo;We  only have Java developers, so we must develop in Java&rdquo;. &ldquo;The existing database  runs on Windows XP only&rdquo;. These are usually nonnegotiable.<br>
    b. Business constraints: These too constraint design  options, but for business, not technical reasons. For example, &ldquo;In order to  widen our potential customer base, we must interface with XYZ tools&rdquo;. Another  example is &ldquo;The supplier of our middleware has raised prices prohibitively, so  we&rsquo;re moving to an open source version&rdquo;. Most of the time, these too are  nonnegotiable.<br>
    c. Quality attributes: These define an application&rsquo;s  requirements in terms of scalability, availability, ease of change,  portability, usability, performance, and soon. Quality attributes address  issues of concern to application users, as well as other stakeholders like the  project team itself or the project sponsor. <br>
    An application architecture must therefore  explicitly address these aspects of the design. Architects need to understand  the functional requirements, and create a platform that supports these and  simultaneously satisfies the nonfunctional requirements</p>
