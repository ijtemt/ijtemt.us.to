<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
  <strong> </strong>In today&rsquo;s dynamic  world, leaders play an important role in every organization. As the competition  between the service oriented organizations is very high, and there is the need  of continuous change and development of these organizations especially for commercial  banks where the only possibility to survive profitably and successfully is due  to the effective and productive leadership. Leadership is process of social  interaction where leaders attempt to influence the behavior of their followers  (Yukl, 2002). Leadership originally was thought to be inherent in an  individual. It was argued that leader was born not made (Bass, 1999).  Leadership has been a hot topic of research for over 50 years. More than 15,000  articles and books have been published. Approximately organizations spend fifty  billion dollars per year on leader&rsquo;s development (Fulmer and Conger, 2004). Regardless  of this knowledge and investment many organizations feel that they have deficiency  of effective leaders. Approximately fifty to seventy five percent leaders do  not perform well (Hogan and Hogan, 2007), the reason behind this is a leader&rsquo;s  negative emotions such as depression, anxiety and irritation; they usually show  on the work place. For decades, relationship of leadership and emotions has been  the topic of debate. Frijda (1988) defines emotions as an &ldquo;action state produce  by a mismatch between an organism&rsquo;s goal and some internal or environmental  stimulus&rdquo;. Interest in emotions in the work place has accelerated rapidly over decades.  The study of emotions in the work settings has a long history. The starting  point for modern research on emotion in organization seems to have been  sociologist (Hochschild, 1983) seminal book on emotional labour: The Managed  Heart. Emotions are known as an inescapable characteristic of organizational  life. Emotions are learned aspects of behavior and are situation specific and  they arte generally not irrational but quiet practical. Negative emotions shown  had a substantial and negative effect on overall organization (Kristi M.  Lewis).This research also to find out the impact of irritation on leader  effectiveness. Negative emotions could also affect follower&rsquo;s perception of  leader&rsquo;s effectiveness and credibility (Congers and Kanungo, 1994). The  objective of the study is to find out the impact of depression, anxiety and  irritation on leader&rsquo;s performance. In this study focus is  at how to deal with negative emotions of leaders in order to make them more  effective and productive. The aim of this research was to find out the impact  of depression on leader effectiveness. This research also aims to find out the  impact of anxiety on leader performance of banking sector Pakistan. Research is  going to conduct in Islamabad/Rawalpindi; different bank managers are surveyed  through questionnaire to clearly examine the extent to which their negative  emotions affect their performance. In this ever changing world of today it is difficult for the  organization to survive without effective leaders. As the competition is very  high and the leader is responsible to bring change and continuous development  in organizations especially for commercial banks. Leader&rsquo;s emotions cannot be  denied in any field of life, especially in service sectors where the people are  in direct relationship with them, such as health education and banking. As far  as banking sector is concerned leader&rsquo;s negative emotions such as depression,  anxiety, irritation, fear, anger, strain etc will directly affect their work.  As in banks there are more complexed work, long timings, more routine and  systematic activities, leader consider their job as a burden and usually show  negative emotions like they become depressive, anxious, stressful, angry and  irritating. The finding of this study would be how a leader must deal  effectively end efficiently with his negative emotions in order to get maximum  productivity and high performance outcomes in the banking sector. Most of the  organizations in today&rsquo;s world have shortage of effective and efficient leaders  in order to compete with other organizations. The leaders who mostly show  negative emotions like anger, fear, depression etc always face difficulties in  dealing with their employees as well as with their customers. Leader&rsquo;s negative  emotions effect his follower&rsquo;s perceptions of leader&rsquo;s effectiveness and  credibility. The leader who shows these negative behaviors is most likely to be  called an ineffective leader who becomes a liability for the organization  despite of an asset. The purpose or rational of this study is to examine the  impact of negative emotions on leader&rsquo;s performance and what measures should be  taken by organizations so that leaders can   overcome their negative emotions in order to improve their performance.  Organizations must introduce some training programs or hire some consular that  provides necessary skills to the leaders that how to control their negative  emotions in their work place settings. In this way leaders will perform  according to the expectations of organization. This study is build on the  following research questions </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>What is the impact of depression       on leader&rsquo;s performance?</li>
  <li>What is the impact of anxiety on       leader&rsquo;s performance?</li>
  <li>What is the impact of irritation       on leader&rsquo;s performance?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Literature review</strong><br>
  Leader&rsquo;s emotion  in work place setting is hot topic in management today. Emotions are more  important in work place than just emotional intelligence. The study of emotions  in organizations settings has provided novel and important understanding of how  people behave in the organization. And there is an instruction for managers to  create and keep a positive emotional climate in their workplaces rather than  negative emotions. Emotions in the work place settings have a long history and  they are the inevitable features of organizational life. They are instrumental  in defining relations of deference, position, status and authority. For  decades, relationship of leadership and emotions has been the topic of debate,  but in last ten years the relationship becomes clearer. Demonstration of  leader&rsquo;s negative emotions had a substantial and severe effect on organization.  As depression, anxiety,  strain, irritation and fear  have  negative impact on leader&rsquo;s performance, covering both personal and  professional aspect, the argument is supported by literature review<em>.</em>(Ronald  J. Bruke,2006) identified the everyday causes of failure and possible corrective  actions. He also analyzed that leaders that failed to behave in a ways  representative of their personality it limits their career. These flaws include  arrogance, insensitivity etc. (Twenge and Campbell,2008) examined that the  number of people being treated for depression is more than tripled in the ten  years period from 1987 to 1997,jumping from 1.8 million to 6.3 million. The  available evidence suggests that anxiety and depression are now common even  apart from more diagnoses and treatment. <br>
  (Pablo Zognbi Manrique De Lara, 2006) analyzed that the general prediction in  the organization and social   psychological literature is the unfavorable perceptions of interactional  justice that can generate the negative emotions such as anger, fear,  resentments etc. He argued that fear is one of the basic negative emotion.  (Sandi.Mann,2006) identifies that particular type of emotional displays are  often most essential for the teams and services work but there are some  emotions that lead towards the potentially stressful work. He also examined  that these emotions must be handled properly. (Alan D.Boss, 2008) analyzed that  how emotional regulation and self leadership can help to move the experience of  personal failure towards recovery. He also suggests that emotional regulation  and self leadership can work together to help those who have experienced  failure and move towards recovery so fast and smoothly than those who are failed  to do so. (Song Heyi and Mao Na Guo Dan, 2007) examine the relationship between  the traits of leaders and the performance of the leader under different  organizational cultures. He regarded that leader&rsquo;s trait as independent  variable and performance as dependent variable; he found that the negative  traits are directly and significantly related to the performance. (Bradley John  Oslan and Nelson, 2006) identifies that work place violence like homicide is  just the tip of ice berg. Work place aggression is the main problem that  affects organizations. He also identifies those organizational and individual  factors that affect both the sense making initiation and the connection between  these initiations and aggressive behavior, and also incorporate a variety of  aggressive behaviors such as violence, verbal abuse, refusal to return  telephone calls etc that usually occurs in an organization. (Thomas W. kent,  2006) describes the relationship of effective leadership with the leader&rsquo;s  ability to handle his or her state of emotions.(Linn Van Dyne, 2002) he  analyses the magnitude of work and non-work sources of strain and work  performance of the multi-dimensional nature . He conclude the results that support  a positive relationship between work strain and employee individual sale  performance and a negative relation between the home strain and employees  creativity at work.(Judith Chapman, 2006) examined that the anxiety associated  with a decision task always leads to defective decision making. He discussed that there are many reasons why managers sometimes  make poor decisions. Understanding the underlying causes can be a confusing  task, but for managers to learn from their mistakes, they need to do so.  (Catherine and Ashkanasy, 2002) he discussed in his paper that the study of  emotions in organizational settings has provided new and important insights in  to the way in which the people in organization behave, and there is a advise  for managers to enable them to develop and to maintain a positive emotional  climate in their organization rather than negative emotions. (Kristi M. Lewis,  2000) observed a male or female leader express negative emotions which was  proposed to influenced the observer&rsquo;s affective state and assessment of the  leader&rsquo;s effectiveness. Kristi also analyzed that negative emotional display had  a significant and negative main effect on participant&rsquo;s assessment of leader&rsquo;s  effectiveness compared to a more neutral emotional display. (Fisher and  Ashkanasy, 2000) analyzed the relationship of mood to job characteristics and  to job satisfaction also the manifestation of anger, perceptions and effects of  emotional labor, emotional intelligence in selection interviews , and the  effects of display of sadness and anger by leaders. Fisher also explores the  relationship between real time mood and emotions while working in an  organization. (Gabriel and Griffiths, 2002) argues that the management of  emotions is problematic. Some emotions may be contained or redirected but many  arise from deeper unconscious sources and are in previous to learning of two  specific emotions anxiety and love. (Marie T. Dasborough, 2002) he examined  that member&rsquo;s attributions about their leader&rsquo;s intentions influence how the  members evaluate, interpret and eventually label the leader&rsquo;s influence  attempts as either &lsquo;true&rsquo; or &lsquo;pseudo&rsquo; transformational leadership. These  attributions are determined by and they influence the member&rsquo;s emotions.  (Michele J. Schmidt, 2010) he argued that leadership preparation programs in  the new millennium should be required to train leaders emotionally as well as  cognitively. (Mchugo, 1991) he examined that attitudes can moderate viewer&rsquo;s  reactions to the expressive displays of a political leader. The study focus on  three indicators that are negative effects, revenge behavior and burnout.(  Harvey and Martinko, 2006) they analyzed that there is a need to develop the  conceptual modal that predicts the influence based causal explanation for  subordinates behavior and outcomes on a leader&rsquo;s functional and the quality of  leader-member relationship. (Mchugo, Lanzetta, Bush, 1991) they examined that  expressive display of emotions are information –laden and evocative. They are  dispositional and situational information and can produce the emotional  reactions. In addition to their role as social signals expressions of emotions  can evoke facial muscles and autonomic responses in observer.  (Hunter, Tate,  Dzieweczynski, Avers, 2011) they examined that errors make up a  substantial portion of the fabric of leadership; there is a very little  knowledge about how and why they occur. The results of the effort reveal  several key themes, including the negative impact of timeframe, complex  influence of expertise, causes of rigidity in problem solving, and the key role  of the subordinate in minimizing the negative impacts of error. A closer  consideration of these themes reveals several practical and theoretical  implications for reducing the frequency and severity of leader errors. (Little,  Simmons and Nelson, 2007) they analyzed that the health of an organization&rsquo;s  leader has profound implications not only for the leader, but also for the  organization itself and for its members. In this study they focused on the  positive stress response in three indicators (negative effect, burnout, revenge  behavior) of distress, the negative stress response, in relation to the health  of pastors, whose jobs closely parallel those of leaders in all types of  organizations. They analyzed that the results indicated that both positive  affect and revenge behavior were significantly related to health. A post-hoc  analysis indicated that work–family conflict was negatively related to revenge  behavior, while family–work conflict was positively related to revenge  behavior, and that engagement was negatively related to revenge behavior. (Tassinary and   Cacioppo, 2011) examined that analyses of overt facial actions in  emotion have contributed in myriad ways to theory and research on emotion.  The sensitivity of the problem has been  diminished by the use of facial electro-myography (EMG). They analyzed that  overt facial expressions are the result of varied and specific movements of the  facial skin and connective tissue caused by the con-traction of facial muscles  which are created due to negative emotions. These movements create folds,  lines, and wrinkles in the skin and the movement of facial land-marks, such as  the brows and corners of the mouth.<br>
  <strong>H1:</strong> anxiety has significant impact on leader&rsquo;s performance<br>
  <strong>H2</strong>: irritation has significant impact on leader&rsquo;s performance<br>
  <strong>H3</strong>: depression has significant impact on leader&rsquo;s performance</p>
<p><strong>Methodology</strong><br>
  Primary data is obtained from the managers of banks operating in  Rawalpindi/Islamabad through self administered survey questionnaires. Target  population included branch managers as well as operational managers, non  probability sampling is used, and sample includes all levels / categories of  100 managers by using convenience sampling method. It is quantitative study, data  is collected from leaders and managers working in their normal routine, no  changes are made in their work setting. The 5 point likert scale is used to  measure level of impact; 1) strongly disagree 2) disagree 3) neither agree/nor  disagree 4) agree 5) strongly agree, for the collection of data<strong>:</strong>The  questionnaire comprises of two parts; part 1 comprising items seeking negative  emotions such as anger, anxiety, depression, irritation.  Part 2 consists of items, which sought to  collect information about the independent variables leader&rsquo;s performance which include  leader&rsquo;s effectiveness. The subjects will be given the questionnaire in their  place of work. Instructions on how to fill the questionnaire are given.  Confidential treatment of information will be assured.</p>

<p><strong>Regression  analysis </strong></p>
<p>According to regression model, all  variables are significance. Coefficient, anxiety which means, decrease in 1  unit of anxiety, leader performance will increase by 0.555 units. Coefficients  of depression are negative and depression beta value is 0.623. It means, if  there is decrease in 1 unit of depression will increase 0.623 units in leader  performance in banking sector. Coefficients of irritation is negative , It  means, if  there is  decrease in 1 unit of irritation will increase  0.255 unit in leader performance in banking sector. This table explains the  percentage of variations in leader performance is explained by the variables  entered in regression equation (R-Squared=66.1%, Adjusted R-square= 65.0%).  Hence 66.1% variation in the leader performance is explained by the anxiety,  depression and irritation. F-value is statistically significant at 0.000. It  shows the fitness of the model. According to these findings we are able to  accept H1, H2 and H3. </p>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong><br>
  Our data suggest that negative emotions  have a significant impact on the leadership performance of the banking sector.  There are three elements which measure the negative emotions of banking sector  top management like anxiety, depression and Irritation. It provides a realistic  help to the argument that anxiety decreases the performance of top management  of the banking sector. The finding shows that tendency of mangers have the same  opinion that anxiety decreases their performance. The relationship between  anxiety and leadership performance keep the management of banking sector in  social frame of mind. Depression has significant and negative relation with top  management of banking sector it provides a realistic help to hypotheses that  relationship between depression and leader performance effects effectiveness in  performance of top management in banking sector. Results indicates that  Irritation decreases the performance of the   top management of banking sector because when he fell angry he take  wrong decisions and failed to motivate the subordinates which leads to  decreases the performance and also effects the leader productivity. When leader  fell annoyed it impact on his communications skills due to which coordination is  difficult and negative effect the leader performance.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
  All of us experience failure many times  in our lives. Some fail miserably and get over it quickly, while others let it  completely take over their lives. However, failure is not a<br>
  Permanent state,  and there are actions that can facilitate recovery. Most of the organizations  in today&rsquo;s world have shortage of effective and efficient leaders in order to <br>
  Compete with  other organizations and this is the biggest reason behind their failure. The  leaders who mostly show negative emotions always face difficulties in their  work place settings. This study analyses that leader&rsquo;s negative emotions such  as anxiety, irritation and fear effect his follower&rsquo;s perceptions of leader&rsquo;s  effectiveness and credibility. Leader&rsquo;s negative emotional display had a  significant and drastic effect on organization as well as on leader&rsquo;s  performance. In particular, individuals who are expert to control their  negative emotions create their own opportunity to emerge from failure and  return to an equilibrium state of recovery. Leadership preparation programs  are, more than ever before, key factors in preparing leaders of today, not only  by including discussions about the nature of emotions as researched in the  literature, but also by providing safe venues in which to discuss ways to face  the changing landscape in education and, in particular, by preparing  administrators to Manage a complex role that has the potential of being both  emotionally exhilarating and dangerously emotionally debilitating.  Organizations must introduce some training programs or hire some counselor who  provides necessary skills to the leaders that how to control their negative  emotions in their work place settings. In this way leaders will perform  according to the expectations of organization. We conclude <br>
  that the study  of emotions in organizational settings has provided new and important insights  into the way in which people in organizations behave. We offer advice for  managers to enable them to develop and to maintain a positive emotional climate  in their organization because the organizations with negative emotional climate  are often less effective and low productive.</p>
