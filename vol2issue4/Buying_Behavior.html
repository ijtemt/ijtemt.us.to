    Keywords-  Rural consumer, rural economy, market potential,  rural credit.</p>
  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p> Rural markets in India have assumed  significance in the recent past with the growth of the Indian economy. More  income &amp; employment opportunities in rural areas has increased the  purchasing power of rural consumers. Rural reach is on the rise and it is fast  becoming the most important route to growth for the Industry. New approaches,  new strategic alternatives and new operational techniques are being evolved to  gain competitive advantage. Rural markets hitherto, found unattractive have  become the new targets to corporate enterprises, mainly for two reasons. Urban  market has become congested with too many competitors. Also markets have  reached a near saturation point. Rural markets have become the main street with  potential for consumption variety of products and services. For many a product  a product rural market provides a promise owing to lag in adaptation. It makes  market entry easy. Large population raising prosperity, growth in consumption,  life style changes, and life cycle advantages market growth rates higher than  urban and inexpensive strategies are the various factors which have made rural  market viable.<br>
    The  product is at the heart of the marketing effort for any company. Rural products  can be classified into. Rural products are FMCG, Consumer Durables, Services,  Agriculture Input.<br>
    There is a huge market potential for fast moving consumer goods in  rural markets. In this category, toilet soaps assume great significance on a  daily basis. The aspect of hygiene is very important in rural areas and toilet  soaps definitely contribute to cleanliness &amp; hygiene. Profits would come  naturally.<br>
    Leading  companies like HLL, Dabur, P&amp;G, Marico, Colgate-Pamolive and callinkare are  targeting rural markets with their personal care and beauty products, soft  drink majors like Coca-cola, Pepsi are also going rural in a big way the reach  of FMCG companies now extends even to the remotest villages of India.<br>
    Researchers have done lot of work related to understanding the  behavior of consumers in rural parts of India, but not much significant  research has been done in detail to analyze consumer behavior in rural areas  regarding toilet soap.</p>
  <h1> <strong>Review of literature </strong></h1>
  <p>First, the  rise of rural markets has been the most important marketing phenomenon of the  1990s. Providing volume growth to all leading companies, many corporate have  been trying to get a grip on rural market. But the challenges are many.<br>
      How to make the product affordable<br>
    How  to penetrate villages with small populations, connectivity, communication,  language barriers, spurious brands etc.<br>
    The  reasons why companies are going rural are manifold. Higher rural incomes driven  by agricultural growth, increasing enrolment in primary schools, high  penetration of TV and other mass media have increased the propensity to consume  branded and value added products in rural areas.<br>
    Marketers  and manufacturers are increasingly aware of the burgeoning purchasing power,  vast size and demand base of the once neglected Indian hinterland. Efforts are  now on to understand the attitude of rural consumers and to walk their walk and  talk their talk. The marketing mix of many companies is now being tailored to  rural tastes and lifestyles mire electronics which owns the Onida television  brand, launched Igo, which was positioned as a value for money brand targeted  at rural markets, especially at customers who were upgrading their black and  white TVS, which constitutes 65% of total colour television buyers. The ad  campaign screamed loudly in rural lexicon &ldquo;Kasam se, Kya TV hai&rdquo;. The Indian  hinterland has been transformed from a balk to the roots holiday destination to  a business proposition government agencies like IRDA( Insurance Regulatory and  Development Authority, and NCAER(National Council for Applied Economic  Research) Define &ldquo;rural&rdquo; as villages with a population of less than 5,000 with  75% of male population engaged in Agriculture etc&rdquo;.<br>
    Two-thirds  of the country‟s consumers (more than 700 million) live in rural areas and  almost 26% of the national Income is generated there and 10 consecutive good  monsoons have led to improved returns from agriculture (which is India‟s  largest economic sector and account for 26% of GDP, Increasing the spending  power in India‟s rural areas. India is divided into 897 districts and her  638,667 villages of which 32% can be reached and are connected by pucca roads.  However, 68% of the rural market lies untapped due to various reasons ranging  from inaccessibility to lack of awareness.<br>
    In  all, there are more than 3.8 million retail outlets in rural India, Averaging  5.8 shops per village (the term &bdquo;shop‟ refers to any type of premises haats,  stalls, shacks- that sell goods). Overall the rural market has been growing at  3-4 percent per annum, adding more than 1 million mew consumers every year, and  now accounts for close to 50% of the volume of consumers of Fast moving  consumer goods (FMCG) In India as a result, it is becoming an important part of<br>
    The  market, development strategies of all FMCG companies, including multinational  ones, as well as consumer durables business and service companies as well.<br>
    The  concept of rural product is unique since it has been observed that the rural  consumer‟s outlook is very different from that of his urban counterpart, and  what works for the latter may not work for the former. Most companies treat  rural markets as dumping ground for lower end products designed for and urban  audience. They could benefit tremendously by using a little bit of their  technological expertise to create specific products for the rural economy (e.g.  Hindustan Lever Limited)<br>
    The  product has to satisfy rural needs and must be affordable. The type of product  that a rural consumer intends to buy, or has the potential to purchase, also  depends on his attitude towards it and the cost benefit analysis done by his  before buying it.</p>
  <h2> Operation Bharat- HLL&rsquo;s  rural product strategy&rsquo;s</h2>
  <p> HLL launched operation  Bharat in the year 1997 to create brand awareness for its rural brands. The  strategy also unvalued promoting the sales of its &ldquo; special packs&rdquo; for rural  areas HLL provided hamper at discounted prices of Rs 5, Rs 10, Rs 15 and Rs 20,  each of which had a clinic shampoo bottle, a tube each of which had a clinic  shampoo bottle, a tube each of Pepsodent and Fair &amp; Lovely, and Pond‟s  Dreamflower talc, in different sizes and combinations the Idea? To have a  product each for hair care, dental care, skin care and body care. Consumer were  also made aware of the benefits of using HLL products, and the affordability of  the pack sizes on offer the project thus successfully addressed issues of  awareness attitudes and habits. Hopefully as consumers in rural areas get  exposed to such value added, value for money, alternatives, they will continue  to buy the different categories of products. Operation Bharat is now targeting  65,000 villages and the strategy has proved to be successful for HLL.<br>
    Namasivayam  (1988) in &ldquo;Impact of advertisement on consumer preference for toilet soaps&rdquo;  suggests that audio visual advertisement is the most important factor that  induces customers to select a particular brand.<br>
    N.Ravishankar,  A.S.Rajarao &amp; B.P.Raju (1995) in &ldquo;Rural Markets – Features &amp; Marketing  Strategies&rdquo; suggest that marketers are looking at rural markets as competition  in urban centres is getting fierce. The authors feel that the marketing mix  must be assembled keeping in mind the unique requirements of the rural market.<br>
    P.  Indrasena Reddy (1996) in &ldquo;Rural Marketing in India-Problems &amp; Prospects&rdquo; emphasizes  on product planning for rural markets. The product design, colour, size and  quality must be in tune with the tastes and preferences of the rural consumer.  He is of the opinion that good infrastructure is an essential prerequisite for  development of rural markets. Moreover, there is need to train and develop the  sales force to serve the rural consumers.<br>
    C.  Madhavi &amp; S. Arul Kumar (2006) in their study &ldquo;Rural Marketing for FMCG&rdquo;  found that most of the consumers are influenced by the quality of the product,  followed by price. Rural consumers expect quality products (functional aspects)  at a reasonable price.<br>
    Mishra  &amp; Sakthivel (2005) in &ldquo;Effectiveness of sachets in modifying rural  consumers‟ buying behavior and their consumption pattern&rdquo; suggest that it is a  bold move by FMCG conglomerates to motivate rural consumers to try new  products. Sachets have proved to be a promotional tool rather than innovative  packaging.<br>
    Mr.  G. Sitamber (1979) in his research study titled &ldquo;Consumer‟s Shopping Behaviour&rdquo;  (A Study in Semi-Urban area) is of the opinion that the consumer has little  choice in choosing a particular item. The wholesaler &amp; the retailer extend  marketing even to the doorstep of the consumer with their wide network of  operations and supply what the consumer requires to fulfill his day to day  needs.</p>
  <h1>Need For Study </h1>
  <p>Before  Many of the researchers in previous years had done a lot of work on consumer  behaviour in urban and rural market. But no significant research was attempted  to explore the market potential for toilet soap in rural areas. Having analysed  the various facts and figures pertaining to consumer behaviour on for moving  consumer goods, the researcher fill the need of doing the research on consumer  behaviour of toilet soaps on the hygiene aspect of the rural people as it is  the need of hour today to enhance their living style on health grounds.<br>
    In  1949 Asian Paints was the first company to enter rural markets. In 1960s HLL  saw rural markets as an opportunity and entered with Lifebuoy soap. Today HLL  dominates rural markets and has a presence in more than one lack villages.  Major players like Colgate, Dabur etc followed suit.<br>
    MNCs  like Proctor &amp; Gamble also started rural marketing.<br>
    Today  around 70% of the population lives in rural India (more than 700 million). 1%  increase in their purchasing power would lead to an increase of Rs 10,000 crore  in government revenues. Companies are launching a plethora of products to cater  to changing lifestyles in rural India. MNCs like LG, Samsung and Revlon and  Insurance biggies like Birla Sunlife, Max Newyork life and prolife are entering  the rural market in a big way, currently however, these companies have tapped  only one lakh of the 6 lakh oat villages.<br>
    The  media explosion and satellite invasion have brought about drastic changes in  the easuming habits of rural Indians and the future would hold a lot in store  for companies entering rural markets. New player like Nestle, McDonalds and<br>
    MTV  are eyeing rural markets, and companies like HLL plan to extend their reach to almost  2.5 lakh villages.<br>
    This  study seeks to understand the behavior of rural consumers with special  reference to toilet soaps and would serve the interests of academics,  researchers and corporate.</p>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>The  main objective of the study is to read the mind of the rural consumer in Kumaun  Region of Uttarakhand. Toilet soap has been chosen as a sample product to  understand the intricacies of buyer behavior of the rural consumer.<br>
    The  secondary objectives of the study are-<br>
      To analyze the demographical status of consumers in rural Uttarakhand.<br>
      To analyze consumer attitudes towards purchase of toilet soaps.<br>
      To determine factors influencing the purchase of toilet soaps.<br>
      To suggest strategies to influence the buyer behavior in rural markets and tap  the huge potential.</p>
