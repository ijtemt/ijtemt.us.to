<p>This document was created using a Contractology  template available at http://www.ijtemt.org </p>
<p><strong>What is spam?</strong></p>
<p>In the context of electronic messaging, spam refers to  unsolicited, bulk or indiscriminate messages, typically sent for a commercial  purpose.  </p>
<p>IJTEMT has a zero-tolerance spam policy. </p>
<p><strong>Automated spam filtering</strong></p>
<p>IJTEMT's messaging systems automatically scan all  incoming email [and other] messages, and filter-out messages that appear to be  spam.  </p>
<p><strong>Problems with spam filtering</strong></p>
<p>No message filtering system is 100% accurate, and from  time to time legitimate messages will be filtered-out by [IJTEMT'S]  systems.  </p>
<p>If you believe this has happened to a message you have  sent, please advise the message recipient by another means.</p>
<p>You can reduce the risk of a message being caught by  the spam filters by sending the message in plain text (i.e. no HTML), removing  any attachments, and ensuring that your messages are scanned for malware before  dispatch.</p>
<p>[<strong>User spam</strong></p>
<p>IJTEMT provides a facility that enables users to send  [email messages / private messages] to others.   Users must not use this facility to send unsolicited, bulk or  indiscriminate messages, whether or not for a commercial purposes.  Full terms and conditions concerning the use  of the facility are set out in [DOCUMENT].]</p>
<p>[<strong>Receipt of unwanted messages from IJTEMT</strong></p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you receive any message from  IJTEMT or sent using [IJTEMT'S] systems that may be considered to be spam,  please contact IJTEMT using the details below and the matter will be  investigated.]</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this anti-spam policy</strong></p>
<p>IJTEMT may amend this anti-spam policy at any time by  publishing a new version on this website. </p>
<p><strong>Contact us</strong></p>
<p>Should you have any questions about this anti-spam  policy, please contact IJTEMT.</p>
