    <li>Introduction </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The  role of FDI in the growth process has been a burning topic of debate in several  countries including India. FDI is a vital ingredient of the globalization  efforts of the world economy. The growth of international production is driven by  economic and technological forces. It is also driven by the ongoing  liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and trade policies. One  outstanding feature of the present-day world has been the circulation of  private capital flow in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) in developing  countries, especially since 1990s. Since the 1980s, multinational corporations  (MNCs) have come out as major actors in the globalization context. Governments around  the world— in both advanced and developing countries—have been attracting MNCs  to come to the respective countries with their FDI. This experience may be related  to the broader context of liberalization in which most developing and transition  countries have moved to market-oriented strategies. In this context,  globalization offers an unparalleled opportunity for developing countries like  India to attain quicker economic growth through trade and investment. In the  period 1970s, international trade grew more rapidly than FDI, and thus  international trade was by far than most other important international economic  activities. This situation changed radically in the middle of the 1980s, when  world FDI started to increase sharply. In this period, the world FDI has    increased its importance by transferring  technologies and establishing marketing and procuring networks for efficient  production and sales internationally (ShujiroUrata, 1998).<br>
    FDI flows comprise  capital provided by foreign investors, directly or indirectly to enterprises in  another economy with an expectation of obtaining profits derived from the  capital participation in the management of the enterprise in which they invest.  The foreign investors acquire ownership of assets in the host country firms in proportion  to their equity holdings. This is the empirical definition of FDI adopted by  many countries to distinguish it from portfolio flows. According to  International Monetary Fund (IMF), FDI is defined as &ldquo; an investment that is  made to acquire a lasting interest in an enterprise operating in a economy  other than that of the investor&rdquo; The investor&rsquo;s purpose is to have an effective  voice in the management of the enterprise (IMF,1977).FDI is the process by  which the residents of one country (the source country) acquire the ownership  of assets for the purpose of controlling the production, distribution and other  productive activities of a firm in another country (the host country).<br>
    Since  the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, the relationship between Foreign Direct  investment (FDI), exports and economic growth has gained importance and attention  among policy makers and researchers. The concept of &lsquo;Investment led Economic  Development&rsquo; has promoted the idea that the outward and inward FDI position of  a country is linked to its economic development relative to the rest of the  world. It recommends that the countries changes through five different stages  of development.<br>
    These  stages are being classified according to the propensity of the countries to the  outward and/or inward investors (Dunning and Narula, 1999). This propensity, in  turn, depends on the extent and pattern of the ownership specific advantages of  domestic firms, its location advantages and the degree of utilization of the  ownership specific advantages by the domestic and foreign firms in the  internationalization of markets.<br>
    The gap between the  world's rich and poor countries largely comes down to the financial and  physical assets that create wealth. Developed economies posses more of this  capital than developing ones, and what they have, usually incorporates more  advanced technologies. The implication is clear: A key aspect of economic  advancement lies in poorer nations' capacity to acquire more capital and scale  the technological ladder. Emerging economies undertake some capital formation  on their own, but in this era of globalization, they increasingly rely on  foreign capital Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has appeared as the most  significant source of external resource flows to developing countries over the  years and has become a significant part of capital formation in these  countries, despite their share in global distribution of FDI continuing to  remain small or even declining. The effects of FDI in the host economy are  usually believed to be increase in the employment, augment in the productivity,  boost in exports and amplified pace of transfer of technology. It facilitates the  utilization and exploitation of local raw materials, introduces modern  techniques of management and<br>
    marketing, eases the  access to new technologies, foreign inflows can be used for financing current  account deficits, finance flows in form of FDI do not generate repayment of principal  and interests (as opposed to external debt) and increases the stock of human  capital via on the job training.<br>
    The effect of FDI on  growth rate of output was constrained by the existence of diminishing returns  of physical capital. Consequently, FDI could only put forth an effect on the  level of output per capita, but not on the growth rate. In other words, it was  unable to modify the growth of output in the long run. In the context of the  new theory of Economic Growth, FDI is considered as an engine of growth of mainstream  economies. As noted by the World Bank (2002), several recent studies concluded  that FDI can promote the economic development of the host Country by promoting  productivity growth and export. However, the exact relationship between foreign  multinational corporations and their host countries varies considerably between  countries and among industries. The characteristics of the host country and the  policy environment are important determinants of net benefit of FDI.<br>
    In view of the above  discussion, this discussion provides rich insight into the relationship between  FDI and Growth. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to analyze the causal relationship  between Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and economic growth in India. The  present paper tries to analyze<br>
    and empirically estimate  the effect of FDI on economic growth in India, using the co integration  approach for the period, 1990-91 to 2010-11.<br>
    Indeed total capital flows to developing  economies have sky rocketed from $104 billion in 1980 to $472 billion in 2006. The  foreign capital has the potential to deliver enormous benefit to developing  nations. Besides helping bridge the gap between savings and investment in  capital-scarce economies, capital often brings with it modern technology and  encourages development of more mature financial sectors. Capital flows have  proven effective in promoting growth and productivity in countries that have  enough skilled workers and infrastructure. Some economists believe capital  flows also help discipline governments&rsquo; macroeconomic policies.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Capital Flows Come  In Three Primary ways</em></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Portfolio equity investment,  which involves buying company shares, usually through stock markets, without  gaining effective control.</li>
      <li>Portfolio debt investment,  which typically covers bonds and short and long-term borrowing from banks and  multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank.</li>
      <li>Foreign direct investment  (FDI), which involves forging long-term relationships with enterprises in  foreign countries.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><em>FDI and Growth:</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Despite FDI&rsquo;s potential to boost technology, productivity,  investment and savings, economists have somewhat surprisingly- struggled to  find a strong causal link to economic growth. Some studies have detected a  positive impact, but only if the country has a threshold level of human  capital. This seems to confirm FDI's important role in propelling growth in  India, which have vast, untapped technical workforces. China graduates 600,000  engineers every year; India produces 215,000.<br>
    A stumbling block to identifying FDI's impact on growth lies in the  fact that these investments can be the cause as well as the result of economic  vitality because foreign capital beats a path to the world's hottest developing  –market economies. Other problems make it difficult to disentangle FDI's effect  on GDP growth. For countries with high tariff and non-tariff barriers, FDI may  simply be the result of multinational corporations trying to access domestic  markets because the export route has been closed. In the case, FDI may  contribute to economic growth, but the impact will be reduced to the extent  high tariffs stunt growth.</p>
  <h3>India also woos foreign investors with tax breaks  and subsidies. Fiscal incentives are doubtlessly a good way to promote FDI.  After all, tax havens are prominent FDI recipient. However, researchers have  found that such policies aren't effective ways to reap FDI's economic benefits.  Indeed the policies may create distortions that significantly blunt FDI&rsquo;s  efficiency and productivity gains. Tax incentives may prove wasteful because  FDI responds more to such factors as labor market flexibility, the cost of  doing business and the quality of the infrastructure. </h3>
  <h1>Literature Review </h1>
  <p>The FDI-growth nexus is evidently identified by the neo classical  growth models. The neoclassical growth model considers technological progress  and labour force as exogenous, and thus argues that FDI increases level of income  only while it has no long run growth effect if it does not expand technology.  Long run growth can only be increased through technological and population growth  and if FDI positively influences technology, then it will be growth advancing  (Solow 1956). Somwaru and Makki (2004) indicate that according to recent  endogenous growth theory, FDI can be growth advancing if it results in increasing  returns in production through spillover and technological transfers via  diffusion processes. In addition, Easterly et al. (1995) argue that technology  transfer depends on the diffusion process and that can take place through four  modes: transfer of new technologies and ideas; high technology imports; foreign  technology adoption; and level of human capital. Findlay (1978) presents the  contagion effect of managerial practices and advanced technology introduced by  foreign firms on the host country&rsquo;s technology. Yangruni Wu (1999) emphasizes  the role of the learning process through FDI in the growth of a country. In  contrast, Charkovic and Levine (2002) claim that FDI creates the crowding out  effect on domestic capital and hence the effect of FDI on growth is either  insignificant or negative. In addition, other studies reason that causality can  be the other way and market seeking FDI tends to serve the growing economies.  Similarly, multinational corporations are attracted towards growing and  productive economies.<br>
    Therefore, this bi-directional  behavior between FDI and GDP can create simultaneity bias between the two variables.  Further, there is the similar two-way causality discussion between exports and  GDP. The first is the export led growth hypothesis, while the other equally appealing  hypothesis is that output growth causes export growth. Finally, there is a same  bi-directional argument in the case of FDI and the export nexus. Petri and Plummer  (1998) argue that it is not clear whether FDI causes exports or exports cause  FDI. Then there are other concerns such as specified by Gray (1998) regarding  market seeking (substitute) FDI or efficiency seeking (complement) FDI.<br>
    Furthermore, Kjima  (1973) analyze whether FDI is trade oriented or anti trade oriented. Vernon  (1966) explores whether FDI is at the early product life cycle stage (substitute)  or at the mature stage (complement). The theoretical and empirical literature  on the growth effects of FDI by transnational corporations (TNCs) on host countries  is enormous. Recent researches attempt to analyze the impacts of FDI on host  country&rsquo;s economy and competitiveness of firms, empirical results show that the  consequence is different. Some studies indicate that FDI can stimulate the  economic growth through spillover effect such as new technologies, capital  formulation, the expansion of international trade and the development of human  capital (labor skills and employment) (Alguacil<em>et al</em>., 2002; Baharumshan  and Thanoon, 2006; Balasubramanyam<em>et al</em>., 1996, 1999; Bende-Nabende and Ford,  1998; Borensztein<em>et al.</em>, 1998; Chakraborty and Basu, 2002; De Mello,  1997, 1999; Liu <em>et al</em>., 2002; Wang, 2005). However, others point put  that FDI can offset then economic growth (Bende-Nabende<em>et al</em>., 2003;  Carkovic and Levine, 2005). Bende-Nabendem<em>et al</em>. (2003) found that FDI  in some countries had a negative relation with economic growth.<br>
    Hsiao and Hsiao (2006)  assert that exports increase FDI by paving the way for FDI by gathering information  of the host country that helps to reduce investors. Transaction costs. Also FDI  may reduce exports by serving foreign markets through establishment of  production facilities there. Balasubramanyam et. al. (1996) tested the  hypothesis that exports promoting (EP) FDI in countries like India confer  greater benefit than FDI in other sectors. They have used production function  approach in which FDI is treated as an independent factor input in addition to  domestic capital and labour. As FDI is a source of human capital accumulation  and development of new technology for developing countries, FDI captures such  externalities as learning by watching and/or doing and various spillover effects.  Exports are also used as an additional factor input in this production  function. Once FDI enters a country, some of the erstwhile imports become domestic  products.<br>
    Hence, their output  becomes a part of GDP which needs consideration as a part of output or growth  effect of FDI. In their model, real GDP depends on labour, domestic capital stock,  foreign capital stock, exports, and technical progress through time. Time is an  all inclusive proxy variable which captures the influence of all factors,  including changing technology, that are impounded under the assumption of <em>ceteris  paribus</em>. This is why time is defined as the parameter of functional shift.  Thus, it is erroneous to interpret the coefficient of T as representing change  in technology alone. However, it has become a customary to treat time as a  representative of technological change.<br>
    Borensztein et al.  (1998) examine absorptive capacity of recipient country, which is measured by  stock of human capital required for technological progress; it takes place through  'capital deepening' associated with new capital goods brought into an economy  by FDI. It has been found out that the fructification of growth effect of FDI  requires adequate infrastructure as a pre-requisite.<br>
    A comprehensive study by  Bosworth and Collins (1999) provides evidence concerning the effect of capital  inflows on domestic investment for fifty-eight developing countries during  1978–95. The authors distinguish among three types of inflows: FDI, portfolio  investment, and other financial flows (primarily bank loans). It has been found  out that an increase of a dollar in capital inflows is associated with an increase  in domestic investment of about fifty cents. This result covers significant  differences among different types of inflows. Foreign direct investment appears  to bring about close to a one-for-one increase in domestic investment; there is  virtually no discernible relationship between portfolio inflows and investment  (little or no impact), and the impact of loans falls between those of the other  two. <br>
    These results hold both  for the fifty-eight-country sample and for a subset of eighteen emerging  markets. An additional striking feature of FDI flows that was noted in previous  literature is that the share of FDI in total inflows is higher in riskier  countries, as measured either by countries credit ratings for sovereign  (government) debt or other indicators of country risk. There is also some evidence  that the FDI share is higher in countries where the quality of corporate  governance institutions is lower. One explanation for this is that FDI is more  likely, compared with other forms of capital flows, to take place in countries with  missing or inefficient markets. In such settings, foreign investors will prefer  to operate directly instead of relying on local financial markets, suppliers,  or legal arrangements.<br>
    According to the study  done by Pradeep Agarwal (2000) on economic impact of foreign direct investment  in south Asia by undertaking time-series, cross-section analysis of panel data  from five South Asian countries; India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and  Nepal, that there exist complementarily and linkage effects between foreign and  national investment. Further he argues that, the impact of FDI inflows on GDP  growth rate is negative prior to 1980, mildly positive for early eighties and  strongly positive over the late eighties and early nineties. Most South Asian  countries followed the import substitution policies and had high import tariffs  in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>
    These policies gradually  changed over the 1980s, and by the early 1990s, most countries had largely  abandoned the import substitution strategy in favor of more open international  trade and generally, market oriented policies (PradeepAgrawal, 2000). But the  analysis of Brecher and Diaz-Alejandro (1977), gives us evidence that foreign capital  can lower the economic growth by earning excessive profits in a country with  severe trade distortions such as high tariffs. Maria Carkovic and Ross Levine (2002)  also concluded in their econometric study on FDI and GDP growth that the  exogenous component of FDI does not exert a robust, independent influence on  growth.<br>
    FDI inflows had a significant  positive effect on the average growth rate of per capita income for a sample of  78 developing and 23 developed countries as found by (Blomström teals, 1994).  However, when the sample of developing countries was split between two groups  based on level of per capita income, the effect of FDI on growth of lower  income developing countries was not statistically significant although still  with a positive sign. They argue that least developed countries learn very  little from MNEs because domestic enterprises are too far behind in their technological  levels to be either imitators or suppliers to MNEs.<br>
    Borensztein, et al.,(  1998) found that the effect of FDI on host country growth is dependent on stock  of human capital. They infer from it that flow of advanced technology brought  along by FDI can increase the growth rate only by interacting with country&rsquo;s  absorptive capability. They also find FDI to be stimulating total fixed  investment more than proportionately. In other words, FDI crowds-in domestic investment.  However, the results are not robust across specifications.<br>
    A recent study by Banga  (2005) demonstrates that FDI, trade and technological progress have differential  impact on wages and employment. While higher extent of FDI in an industry leads  to higher wage rate in the industry, it has no impact on its employment. On the  other hand, higher export intensity of an industry increases employment in the industry  but has no effect on its wage rate. Technological progress is found to be labor  saving but does not influence the wage rate. Further, the results show that  domestic innovation in terms of research and development intensity has been  labor utilizing in nature but import of technology has unfavorably affected  employment in India.<br>
    Rajit Kumar Sahoo(2005)  has pointed out that FDI has a direct and indirect impact and on a certain  particular sectors<br>
    of the economy. A study  on the impact of FDI on manufacturing sector reveals that FDI inflows in  chemicals, electrical and electronics shows direct impact and FDI inflow in  drugs and pharmaceutical sectors shows indirect impact (spillover effects). FDI  is an important vehicle for the transfer of technology and knowledge and it demonstrates  that it can have a long run effect on growth by generating increasing return in  production via positive externalities and productive spillovers. Thus, FDI can  lead to a higher growth by incorporating new inputs and techniques (Feenstra  and Markusen, 1994).<br>
    Jaya Gupta (2007) made  an attempt to review the change insectoral trends in India due to FDI Inflows  since liberalization. This paper also examines the changed policy implications  on sectoral growth and economic development of India as a whole. Singh and Jun  (2005) by using a pooled model of developing countries, tested three groups of  hypotheses on what influences direct investment – that political risk matters,  that business conditions matter, that macroeconomic variables matter.<br>
    Finar (2002) argue that  a qualitative index of political risk is a significant determinant of FDI flows  for countries that have historically attracted high FDI flows. For countries  that have not attracted such flows, socio-political instability (proxied by  work hours lost in industrial disputes) has a negative impact on investment  flows Jayashree Bose (2007) in his book studied the sectoral experiences faced  by India and China in connection with FDI inflows. This book provides  information on FDI in India and China, emerging issues, globalization, foreign factors,  trends and issues in FDI inflows, FDI inflows in selected sectors. A comparative  study has also been conducted on FDI outflows from India and China. This book  also revealed the potential and opportunities in various sectors in India that  would surpass FDI inflows in India as compared to China.<br>
    Several studies have  focused on theoretical positive impact of FDI on growth. But there are only few  empirical studies of<br>
    this fact. Both macro  and micro studies have generally been<br>
    Conducted to study the  relationship between FDI and growth. Micro studies find no positive evidence to  support the thesis<br>
    that FDI positively  contributes to growth. Macro studies, have, however, thrown up some evidence to  show that FDI positively affects economic growth under certain conditions.<br>
    Although there are many  literatures between FDI and growth, there are also ambiguous in this issue. UNCTAD  (2002) found that FDI might have positive effect on output for some countries  and negative for others, because of different dependent variables. Compare to  the major literatures of endogenous growth model, it seems that the studies of  the impact of FDI on growth are still too narrow, since there are<br>
    some undecided factors.  First, there are not enough determined proofs to show that FDI has direct real  benefits on growth (or output level), except spillover effect. Second, FDI<br>
    is a new phenomenon in  social, economic and global politics, but the empirical studies in the  long-term relationship between FDI and output are still very few.<br>
    A number of studies have  analyzed the relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth, the issue is  far from settled in view of the mixed findings reached. Most of these studies  have typically adopted standard growth accounting framework for analyzing the  effect of FDI inflows on growth of national income along with other factors of  production. Existing studies do not fully control for simultaneity bias,  country-specific effects, and the routine use of lagged dependent variables in  growth regressions. These weaknesses can bias the coefficient estimates as well  as the coefficient standard errors. Thus, the profession needs to reassess the  macroeconomic evidence with econometric procedures that eliminate these potential  biases. Although there are literatures using VAR or VECM analysis to do Granger  causality test, but most of them were lacking economic theory or ignored  important disturbance variables. Our study will strive to highlight the nexus between  FDI and economic growth in India under co integration framework.<br>
    An export orientation is  the strongest variable explaining why a country attracts foreign direct investment.  Singh and Jun (2005) elaborate the determinants of Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI) by empirically analyzing various factors including-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Political risk,</li>
    <li>Business conditions, and</li>
    <li>Macroeconomic variables</li>
  </ul>
  <p>According to them these are the factors that influence direct  investment flows to developing countries. Singh and Jun (2005) also explain  that exports generally, especially manufacturing exports, are a significant  determinant of FDI flows for countries in which FDI is high. This fact is  further supported by standard regression analysis and by Granger causality  tests, which indicate that the feedback is predominantly from exports to FDI.  Export orientation is the strongest variable for explaining why a country  attracts FDI. This finding is in line with the secular trend toward increasing  complementarities between trade and FDI.</p>

  <ul type="disc">
    <li>To find out the relationship of Inflow       of FDI with the development of India's economy (measured in terms of GDP)</li>
    <li>To study if there is an impact of       economic reforms on FDI or not.</li>
    <li>To have an insight of the areas where       further reforms in FDI are needed.</li>
    <li>To study the major constraints on FDI in       India.</li>

  <h2>Impact of Foreign Direct Investment </h2>
  <p>India today is ranked among the most  favored destinations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), with the services  sector at the top in attracting FDI in April-November 2006. India has also emerged  as the most ATTRACTIVE FDI DESTINATION in Asia with an 18 percent rate of  return on equity investments. However, experts are still divided on the  problems and prospects of FDI in retail. Some say it will shrink employment  opportunities, completely alter the retail distributional structure and deal a  death below to the corner shop structure. The optimists, on the other hand, see  a whole range of opportunities – from improved collection, processing and  better distribution of farm products to generation of more opportunities for  the rural and urban unemployed.<br>
    FDI flows into India are mostly in  IT and communications centre. Despite India&rsquo;s successful positioning as a  business processing and IT outsourcing hub, these activities often translate  into Indian Services sector exports via third-party transactions- not FDI.  India has yet to build a critical mass in FDI having only initiated investment  attracting reforms in 1991. There have recently been positive signs of increased  FDI into other sectors. Despite the attention to services outsourcing, two of  the sectors that received large amount of inward FDI in 2005 were automobile  manufacturing and mining.<br>
    FDI into India will grow but will  remain very low in relation to the size and potential of its economy. However,  some of the world&rsquo;s leading MNCs are taking an active interest in the country.  Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Posco and an AMD- backed chip fabrication consortium  have proposed large multi-year investments. The recent increase in the ceiling  on foreign ownership in some telecoms services to 74% (from 49%) and in civil  aviation companies to 49% (from 24%) is also helping to generate greater  inflows. Although manufacturing is generally open to foreign investment and  there has recently been substantial liberalization of the FDI regime in some  sectors, such as telecoms, FDI opportunities in other sectors are limited.  Inflexible labor laws are also restricting FDI- inflows into India, despite its  huge potential and growth prospects. India&rsquo;s ability to attract FDI is also  hampered by its poor infrastructure. A recent survey by KPMG showed that India&rsquo;s  poor infrastructure (the road network, the ports, the distribution networks and  in particular the power supply) is a cause for concern and a major barrier to  investment. Most of the companies surveyed doubted that rapid changes could be  made to solve the infrastructure issues. The scope for making improvement is  limited by the state of Public Finances. The combined deficit of the federal  and state government is running at around 10% of GDP.<br>
    In investor surveys,  India continues to lag far behind China as a preferred destination for  investment. For example, in a recent survey of MNC executives conducted by  Ernst &amp; young, only 18% of respondents cited India as one of their three  preferred locations for investment, compared with a figure of 41% for China.</p>

    H0-inflow of FDI has no relation  with the development of India's economy (measured in terms of GDP).<br>
    H1-There is a positive relation  between inflow of FDI and the development of India's economy (measured in terms  of GDP)<br>
    Hypothesis Testing: To show whether  Inflow of FDI and Development of India's economy (measured in terms of GDP) are  related or not, Karl Pearson's Coefficient of correlation will be used<br>
    Hypothesis-2<br>
    H0- There  is no impact of economic reforms on Foreign Direct Investment.<br>
    H1- There  is an impact of economic reforms on Foreign Direct Investment.<br>
    Hypothesis  Testing: To show whether there is an impact of economic reforms on Foreign  Direct Investment or not, chi square test will be used.<br>
    B.2 Testing of Hypothesis<br>
    <strong>i ). Karl Pearson's Coefficient of  Correlation</strong> <br>
    The  first hypothesis seeks to check whether there is a relation between inflow of  FDI and the economic development of India measured in terms of GDP. For testing  this hypothesis Karl Pearson's coefficient of correlation is calculated.<br>
    Karl Pearson's coefficient of correlation is a Non-parametric  method. It is used to determine the degree of relation between 2 variables of a  nominal scale. It is used to find out the extent of degree of relationship  between variables.<br>

    r (correlation)  =   0.811 <br>
    Karl Pearson's Coefficient of Correlation = 0.811<br>
    So, from the above calculation we can say that correlation  coffiecient between the X and Y is positive so the Null Hypothesis H1 get  accepted. This we can say that there is a positive correlation between inflow  of FDI and the development of Indian economy (measured in term of GDP).<br>
    B.2 Testing of Hypothesis -2</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CHI-Square</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The  second hypothesis seeks to measure whether there is an impact of economic  reforms on FDI or not. Chi square test is a non- parametric test which is used  to test the association or interdependence of variables and to check the  goodness of fit.</p>
  <p>The test will help to find out that whether  there is any impact of economic reforms on FDI or not.</p>

    <li>MAJOR  FINDINGS </li>
  </ul>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>A       large number (80%) of respondents agreed that the constraints on FDI India       are Poor infrastructure, labor laws, tax laws, financial sector and       political climate.</li>
    <li>48.57%       of the respondents also agreed that the inflow of FDI in India is quite       satisfactory.</li>
    <li>The       study also reveals that there is a positive relationship between the       inflow of FDI and the development of India's economy (measured in terms of       GDP). This is evidenced in the first hypothesis tested in which the       calculated value of Correlation is 0.51.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Also  the study depicts that there is an impact of economic reforms on FDI. This fact  is evidenced in second hypothesis wherein the calculated value of Chi square is  23.96 which is greater than table value 5.991.</p>
  <h5><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
  <p>India  is becoming one of the hottest investment destinations among the various  investment options in the fast growing emerging economies. The booming Indian  economy has a lot to offer to foreign investors, foreign institutional investors,  venture capitalists, and portfolio managers etc. to leverage vast pool of  natural, human and intellectual resources of rich Indian economy apart from  various attractive investment opportunities. The developed stock exchange,  liberal investment policy and various other factors have given new dimensions  to the lucrative new of Investment Possibilities in the Indian Economy.<br>
    As  India's economy continues to steadily grow at a reasonably good rate, with a  growing role for the private sector in the economy, the Government would very  much like to encourage greater foreign investment to supplement domestic  resources to achieve target of 10% economic growth over the next five years.</p>
