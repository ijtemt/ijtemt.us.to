Paper Title : <br>Marijuana price estimates and the price elasticity of demand</a></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This study estimates marijuana prices for every state and the District of Columbia by using historical price data of marijuana purchases. A regional price index is constructed and used to estimate regional price differences of marijuana prices for the years 2002-2007. These price estimates are then utilized to calculate recent average price elasticity of demand and the results are compared to the existing literature on price elasticity as measure of accuracy of our marijuana price estimate model. The average price elasticity of demand (PED) for marijuana (less than 10 grams) for the time period 2002-2007 for all ages within the 50 states and the District of Columbia is -0.44. The PED varies by age group, 12-18 Resulting in a PED for ages 12-17 of -1.01, 18-25 of -0.34, and > 26 of 0.17. Significant differences concerning the sensitivity to marijuana prices exist based on age.

  <h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
  <p>Understanding  how price influences consumption is essential when examining drug policies.  Many initiatives have been implemented to reduce marijuana consumption, with  the majority of these programs focusing on disrupting the supply of marijuana  thus increasing the price of marijuana, rather than focusing on demand side  policies. By examining how sensitive consumers are to changes in price, drug  polices can be better designed and evaluated. <br>
    Marijuana is one of the most  commonly used illicit drugs in the world, consumed by about 2.5% of the world&rsquo;s  population [1], as well as the most commonly  used illicit drug in the United States [2]. One-third of the population in  the United States reported consuming marijuana at some point in their lifetime [3]. Illegal drug use produces  enormous social costs. These costs range from increased health care, loss of  productivity, and lower level of educational attainment [4, 5]. High school graduation is  negatively associated with marijuana use, more specifically a 10% increase in  frequent marijuana use lowers the probability of graduation by 6.62% [6]. A 20% reduction in marijuana  use would be associated with a $600 million savings in averted social costs [7]. <br>
    Due to a lack of marijuana price data, the majority of  studies concerning marijuana consumption seek to explain that behavior through  other variables, such as the complementary/substitute nature of cigarettes,  family structure, education, race, medical marijuana regulations, etc. Although  these variables most likely contribute to marijuana consumption, price is a key  factor. This study is an attempt to add to the literature by suggesting current  marijuana prices for every state and the District of Columbia by using historical price data of  marijuana purchases and constructing a regional price index to estimate  regional price differences of marijuana prices for the years 2002-2007. These prices are then utilized to calculate recent average  price elasticity of demand and the results are compared to the existing  literature on price elasticity as measure of accuracy of our marijuana price  estimate model.<br>
    Few studies have examined the price elasticity of demand of  marijuana. The first such study, published in 1972 by Nisbet and Vakil, was the  result of surveying U.C.L.A. students concerning purchasing patterns of  marijuana at changing prices. This survey was designed to determine how many  ounces of marijuana a consumer would purchase at a set income level at varying  prices. The price elasticity of demand for marijuana at the current market  price ranged from -0.40 to -1.51 [8].<br>
    Clements and Daryal examined  price and consumption of marijuana among Australians 14 years and older. The  authors demonstrated a price elasticity of approximately -0.50 [9]. This study employed a per gram  price of marijuana at a constant $450 (AUD). This constant price of marijuana  utilized in this study was derived from the 1989 Cleeland Report, The Illicit  Drugs in Australia, Situation Report, The Australian Illicit Drug Report by the  Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, and a 1997 article in The Australian  Financial Review [9]. All of these sources establish  a per gram marijuana price of between $300 and $800 (AUD).<br>
    Pacula et al. published a study  in 2001 in which marijuana prices were calculated from data published by the  Drug Enforcement Agency during the years 1982-1998. Quarterly street level  marijuana purchase prices from nineteen cities and the District of Columbia  were converted into price per gram and then into real prices by dividing by the  annual consumer price index for the U.S. as a whole [10]. The authors demonstrated a  price elasticity of demand for annual marijuana consumption of high school  seniors of between -0.06 to -0.47 and a thirty-day marijuana consumption  elasticity of between -0.002 to -0.69 [10]. <br>
    van Ours and Williams conducted  research concerning the role price plays in encouraging youth to begin  consuming marijuana. This study utilized the self-reported cannabis consumption  rate of 14 to 22 years of age reported in the 1998 Australian National Drug  Strategy&rsquo;s Household Survey. The authors concluded that cannabis prices have a  negative effect on cannabis starting rates and a price elasticity of -0.47 [11].<br>
    A 2001 published study from  Jacobson examined data from both the Monitoring the Future (a survey high  school students) and the National Household survey on Drug Abuse concerning  youth marijuana use. This study demonstrated that the size of the youth cohort  is negatively related to both the price of marijuana and arrests for drug sales  [12]. Holding youth demand stable and  assuming that youth population changes only affect the supply of marijuana, the  author calculated a price elasticity of -0.85 [12].<br>
    Understanding how price affects  marijuana consumption is critical to developing successful drug policies,  especially due to the fact that more evidence of the harms of marijuana smoking  is becoming available. A correlation has been shown to exist between marijuana  smoking and the development of lung cancer [13]. Marijuana smoke contains  significantly more carcinogens [14,15] and increased tar  delivery to the lungs than tobacco smoke [13]. Cannabis smoke produces mutations  in cells in both test tubes and within live animals and therefore can be a  potential cause of cancer [16]. Regular marijuana use adds  significant risk for the development of respiratory tract carcinoma [17]. When consuming  marijuana, larger puff volumes are taken and the smoke from marijuana is  inhaled more deeply so the individual retains smoke in their lungs  approximately four times longer than tobacco smoke; and the longer  breath-holding time characteristic of marijuana smoking results in a larger  amount of inhaled tar and an even larger amount of tar retained in the lung [13,18].<br>
    Studies have also suggested an  increased risk of other forms of cancers associated with marijuana use. These  include an increased risk of head and neck cancer [14], carcinoma of the tongue [19,20], testicular germ cell tumors [21], and an increased risk of  prostate cancer [22]. Exposing a correlation between  marijuana smoking and various forms of cancer is difficult due to the fact that  many marijuana users also exposed themselves to additional risk factors such as  tobacco and alcohol consumption. <br>
    An  increasing number of studies have provided compelling evidence to conclude that  smoking marijuana can lead to adverse mental health conditions, such as psychosis and depression [23]. Psychosis-free subjects who  have a lifetime history of cannabis use are at increased risk of a psychosis  outcome [24], with one estimate of the risk of  psychosis increasing by approximately 40% [25]. Assuming an increased risk of  psychosis of 40% and a 40% lifetime cannabis use among young adults, one could  expect a 14% reduction in psychotic outcomes if cannabis was not used in  society [25]. <br>
    A correlation between prolonged  cannabis use and psychotic symptoms and persons with schizophrenia has also  been demonstrated. Cannabis use may trigger schizophrenia in persons who are  vulnerable to the disorder; cannabis may also be used to &ldquo;self-medicate&rdquo;  schizophrenia symptoms [26]. These findings were similar to  a previous analysis which concluded that heavy cannabis use at the age of 18  increased the risk of later schizophrenia six-fold [27]. The difficulty lies in deciphering  the degree of correlation and the assumptions surrounding persons who may be  predisposed to certain mental health conditions.<br>
    Cannabis is an addictive  substance and dependence can result from experimentation and recreational use [28]. Marijuana dependence is defined  as the increased tolerance, compulsive use, impaired control, and continued use  despite physical and psychological problems caused or exacerbated by use [29]. More adults in the United  States had a marijuana disorder in 2001-2002 than in 1991-1992 [30], with cannabis dependence being  the most common form of dependence after alcohol and tobacco [16]. Marijuana is much more potent  now than it was in the 1960s, which is one explanation why cannabis-use  disorders in the United States have increased over the past 10 years [31]. From the 1960s to 2000, the THC  level of an average marijuana &ldquo;joint&rdquo; increased from 10 mg to 150 mg [32], an increase of 1,400%. Although  marijuana potency has increased over time and is an important issue to  consider, the lack of standardized testing concerning the potency of marijuana  by law enforcement and the wide variations in marijuana quality lead to  hesitation when using potency as a independent variable.<br>
    The risk of marijuana dependence,  occurring in approximately 10% of users [26], is higher for daily users and  persons who begin consuming marijuana at an early age [33]. This dependence can lead to  serious withdrawal symptoms once the stimulant is removed. Withdrawal symptoms  have been reported by 80% of male and 60% of female adolescents seeking  treatment for cannabis dependence [26]. These withdrawal symptoms are  similar to those of alcohol, opiates, and benzodiazepine withdrawal, which  includes restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, increased aggression, and muscle  tremors [32].<br>
    The risk of death from marijuana  overdose is incredibly low. There are no reported cases of human deaths  attributed to cannabis toxicity [16]. That is not to say that  cannabis toxicity is not possible, it is just extremely unlikely that a person  can consume the quantity needed to cause death. On average, one &ldquo;joint&rdquo;  delivers 3 mg THC to the consumer while the lethal dose is approximately 4,000  mg of THC [34] or more than 1,300 &ldquo;joints.&rdquo; Marijuana associated deaths related to automobile  accidents or other mishaps are more difficult to quantify, due to poor  reporting standards and/or the likelihood of other intoxicants being present in  the individual&rsquo;s system. Also, marijuana is an antiemetic that prevents  vomiting, thus possibly preventing persons who have consumed fatal amounts of  alcohol from vomiting, which may have prevented death.</p>

    <li><em>Price of Marijuana</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Due to the  illegal nature of marijuana, accurate prices by state are difficult to obtain,  however some secondary on prices do exist. Marijuana prices used in this study  were based on data provided by the Office of National Drug Control Policy  (ONDCP).  The ONDCP collected and  published prices for five major illicit drugs (marijuana, powder cocaine, crack  cocaine, heroin, and d-methamphetamine) for the years 1981 through 2007. The  report titled <em>The Price of Illicit Drugs:  1981 through the Second Quarter of 2000</em> was published in October of 2001  with two subsequent updates, which were expanded to include the purity of four  of the illicit drugs, excluding marijuana. <em>The  Price and Purity of Illicit Drugs </em>utilize data from the Drug Enforcement  Agency&rsquo;s System to Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) database.  Prices for illegal drugs are obtained by law enforcement through investigative  and enforcement activities and undercover purchases. Quarterly price of the  illegal marijuana market from 1981 through 2007 are detailed from purchases in  three quantity levels, totaling ≤ 10 grams, 10 – 100 grams, and &gt; 100 grams.  Table 1 displays the median national price per gram of marijuana for quantities  less than 10 grams. </p>

  <p><em>The Price of Illicit Drugs: 1981  through the Second Quarter of 2000</em> report also detailed regional variations in marijuana prices (as well as the  other narcotics studied) by segregating marijuana purchases within six regions:  East Central, Mountain, Northeast, Pacific, Southeast, and West Central. Table  2 lists the states that comprise each region. For this study, median marijuana  prices are expressed in 2007 dollars<em>.</em> Regional price estimates for marijuana were not available after the second  quarter of 2000. Due to this lack of data, a regional index for marijuana  prices was calculated. Using available historical marijuana price data, the  mean price of marijuana for quantities less than 10 grams for the six above  listed regions were divided into the national average marijuana price for that  year. These annual indices for each region were summed for the years 1981-2000  and divided by the number of years of valid data (no region contained less than  13 years of data), resulting in an average price index for that region. Price  indices for the six regions were calculated as East Central 0.712, Mountain  1.156, Northeast 0.944, Pacific 1.038, Southeast 1.152, and West Central 0.887.  This index was then multiplied by the median marijuana price per gram of  marijuana (2007 constant dollars) for quantities of less than 10 grams for the  years 2002-2007. Regional price per gram of marijuana calculated with this  index are displayed in Table 3. </p>

  <p>By using  historical price data of marijuana purchases, a regional price index is  constructed and used to estimate regional price fluctuations of marijuana  prices. Average price elasticity of demand is then calculated using these  prices and previous month consumption data for all 50 states and the District  of Columbia. Price elasticity of demand is a measure of the percentage change  in consumption associated with a 1% change in price [<a href="#_ENREF_35" title="Caulkins, 1998 #355">35</a>] . The formula (1) for the average price  elasticity of demand utilized in this analysis is noted below.<br>

  <h1 align="center">Results </h1>
  <p>The  average price elasticity of demand for marijuana (less than 10 grams) for the  time period 2002-2007 for all ages within the 50 states and the District of  Columbia is -0.44. This suggests that the marijuana is relatively inelastic.  However, the price elasticity varies among age groups. As seen in table 4, as  consumer age decreases marijuana becomes more elastic. Elasticity ranges from  0.17 for ages 26 and up, -0.34 for 18-25, and -1.01 for those age 12-17. As  evident from these results, youths are far more sensitive to price changes than  those age 18 years and greater with regards to marijuana prices.</p>

  <p>Marijuana  is an inelastic good (0.17) for persons age 26 years of age and older. Results  were similar for both decriminalized states (-0.15) and non-medical  marijuana or <br>
    decriminalized states (0.16). In medical marijuana states marijuana approaches  the level of a somewhat inelastic good (-0.31). <br>
    Persons  residing in non-medical marijuana or marijuana decriminalized states are more  responsive to changes in the price of marijuana than those in other states.  Youths age 12-17 are far more sensitive to price changes in these states those  youths in medical marijuana and/or decriminalized states. <br>
    Persons are  also more sensitive to the price of marijuana in decriminalized states than  those in states that allow for the medicinal consumption of marijuana. Again,  these figures may be influenced by the norms and beliefs of persons within  these states regarding marijuana consumption and the likelihood of possible  peer influences leading to marijuana consumption. These factors, as well as the  reduced risk of legal sanctions, greater acceptance, peer influences and peer  pressure, and lower perception of risk, aid in reducing the overall cost of  consuming marijuana leading to increased consumption.</p>
  <h1 align="center">Discussion </h1>
  <p>This article  estimates the average price elasticity of demand for illegal marijuana for the  age groups 12-17, 18-25, and 26 and older using current marijuana price  estimates calculated from historical price data from illegal marijuana  purchases. Our price elasticity for youth ages 12-17 of -1.01, and 18-25 of  -0.34 is comparable to youth price elasticity&rsquo;s found in prior studies, which  ranged from -0.002 to -0.85 [10-12] . <br>
    Two  important conclusions come to light concerning the average price elasticity of  demand for marijuana. First, significant differences appear based on age.  Youth&rsquo;s age 12-17, are far more responsive to prices changes of marijuana than  those age 18-25, and 26 years and older. These differences remain even when  controlling for medical marijuana and decriminalized states. This suggests that  policies that successfully increase the price of marijuana will have a greater  impact in reducing the number of marijuana smokers between the ages of 12-17  than older individuals. <br>
    Secondly,  Controlling for factors such as medical marijuana state and marijuana  decriminalization state reveal that policies designed to increase the price of  marijuana will not lead to similar reductions in marijuana consumption across </p>
</div>
<br clear="all">
<div>
  <p>all 50 states and the  District of Columbia. Marijuana is more inelastic in medical marijuana states  and states in which marijuana is decriminalized. As a whole the average price  elasticity in non-medical marijuana states is -0.71, compared to -0.42 in  decriminalized states, and -0.20 in medical marijuana states. Therefore,  policies aimed at increasing the price of small quantities of marijuana in  these states will not produce similar decreases of marijuana consumption. This  suggests that removing criminal sanctions associated with marijuana smoking  decreases the current cost of consumption.<br>
    One reason  for this increased sensitivity to price may be explained by the fact that  states that uphold restrictions for marijuana consumption aid in conveying  norms and beliefs concerning that behavior, which may further influence youths  decision not to consume marijuana. Also, as medicinal marijuana consumers  increase in number, the social encounters by youths with persons who are taking  or have taken medical marijuana will likely increase [37] . This may act to  reinforce the perception that marijuana use has health benefits and the risk of  harm is exaggerated. <br>
    This goal of this study was to suggest marijuana prices for every state  and the District of Columbia by using estimates of  state by state price fluctuations of quantities of marijuana less than 10  grams. These price estimates were then  used calculate recent average price elasticity of demand that are similar to  previous studies that employed different methods of estimating marijuana price  data. The lack of reliable and accurate data regarding street level  prices of marijuana has restricted many studies concerning marijuana  consumption. This study demonstrates that the current price elasticity of  demand for marijuana varies greatly among different age groups and within  states with different marijuana regulations. These results should be considered  when designing policies that are aimed to reduce marijuana consumption.  Hopefully, these price estimates can add value in analyzing how costs influence  the health risk behavior of marijuana consumption.</p>
