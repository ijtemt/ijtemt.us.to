<h1 align="center">Introduction</h1>
<p>Up to  now, the scholars most focus on analyzing the reasons leading to the loss of the companies, the earnings  management motivation and research methods on the issues of the problem of the  loss listed corporations. The literatures involving the value of loss listing corporations  are relatively small. Can the accounting earnings reflect the real value of  loss listed corporations? Will the loss of continuity and the disclosure of the  annual report of the various themes of events in loss listed corporations influence  their value? If so, what is the mechanism of the effect? Foreign scholars have given  some explanations about this question, such as abandoning option theory, adjusting  the option theory, defaulting option theory, but these theories have some  defects more or less. Based on this, this article is to review the results of  the problems about the valuation of loss companies in the existing capital  market and put forward to some enlightenment.<br>
  In  recent years, foreign researchers and practitioners in financial theory pay  enough attention to the problem of the valuation on loss corporations with the  increasing number of the loss listed companies. The scope  of the existing literatures about loss firms includes the value relevance of  accounting earnings, the heterogeneity of the value of the loss companies, the  value drivers and driving mechanism of the loss corporations and the relation  between the loss reversibility and the value of the loss corporations. They  found some perspectives and experiences which will benefit the valuation of  loss corporations in China's  capital market, which will help to enrich the theoretical system of assessing  value of the company and to judge their reasonable value of the loss listed  corporations on the context of China.</p>
<h1 align="center">The value  relevance of earnings of the loss companies</h1>
<p>The related  study of accounting earnings and stock returns are based on the assumption that  the relationship between them is linearly for a long time by some scholar, such  as Ball and Brown (1968), Beaver (1972), Beaver, Lambert and Morse (1980), Lipe(1986),  Kormendi and Lipe(1987) and Collins and Kothari (1989).They all find that there  is a positive linear correlation relationship between stock price earnings  response level and earnings persistence or surplus time continuity, and that  the reaction of the stock price to loss and profit is homogeneous. In fact,  that is not the case. The correlation relationship between accounting earnings  and stock returns in loss companies is weaker than profit companies. Hayn(1995)  firstly found that phenomenon. And she found that the loss companies (ERC，earnings response coefficient) was significantly lower than the profit  companies, and this is attributed to the liquidation option of the shareholders.  She considered investors they will exercise liquidation option when they realized  losses will continue once the company continues to operate. Therefore, the  recessive liquidation option owned by the shareholders of loss companies will  led to a lower response to earnings value of loss companies. Since then, Jan  and Ou(1995), Samantha Sin and Edward Watts(2000) draw the similar conclusion  to Hayn(1995) by using a variety of different regression models: there is a  significant correlation between liquidation option and the information content of  earnings and the stock value of loss companies.<br>
  Collins,  Pincus and Xie(1999) further put equity book value as an alternative variable of  the abandonment option of loss companies into the surplus capital model, found two  aspects function about the equity book value in the interpretation of loss companies  abnormal negative price-earning relationship:1)can be used as the control  variable to the difference of companies&rsquo; size; 2)can be as the substitution  variable for expected future normal earnings. They think, Burgstahler and  Dichev(1997) regarded the equity book value as the surrogate variable of the adjusting  value of the company, this value represents more extensive resources than abandoning  option value. The expected surplus value is considered as a rescue value, which  steams from the company's current business and technology application. The  adjusting value represents that the company has rights to disposal assets (such  as the sale, transfer, clearing or redeployment) through reconstruction and  other more favorable way. Liquidation or abandon is just the extreme processing  mode in the adjustment mentioned by Burgstahler and Dichev (1997). Therefore,  liquidation value per share is only on behalf of the company's external  adjustment value, and that just applies to the condition that the liquidation  value is higher than the internal asset restructuring proceeds. On the other  hand, if the company through internal capital adjustment income is higher than  the liquidation value, then liquidation value per share as the adjustment value  of alternative variables is not appropriate. Therefore, future research should  absorb interior modulation value variables such as income, which can join the  reconstruction variable to deal with the condition that interior modulation  values is higher than the value of the external adjustment. Zhang (2000) also  shows in his empirical study: (1) there is a positive correlation between accounting  earnings and stock price of loss companies by use of a simple model  of surplus capital, but their relationship is no longer significant when considering  the impact of the equity book on stock prices after further controlling the  company size and the proportion of shares in circulation; (2) there is a positive  correlation between equity book value and stock price of loss companies, and  support the hypothesis that equity book value represent the liquidation value of  loss company. This agrees with the researching conclusion of Collins, Pincus  and Xie (1999).<br>
  The  results above the scholars about the value relevance of accounting earnings in loss  companies are not entirely consistent. Some found there is weak positive  correlation between accounting earnings and stock price when using the  accounting earnings as variables to return on the stock price, some found there  is no correlation between them, and others they found there is a negative  correlation between them. Investigating its reason, it is possible that these  studies did not take into account the heterogeneity among loss companies, on  the contrary, all the loss companies were regarded as the same nature samples  to study together, this is clearly not enough accurate to mistaken the same relations  between accounting earnings and stock price correlations for all loss companies.</p>
<h1 align="center"> Comparison the value of loss companies based  on the heterogeneity of the classification</h1>
<p>Despite the  above scholars study on the value relevance of accounting earnings in loss  companies from different angles and their theoretical explanations also are not  identical, they almost believe that the basic reason which causes the instable relationship between the loss companies  accounting earnings and stock price is missing some variables. Obviously, they  ignore the possibility of the internal differences among loss companies. In  fact, loss heterogeneity among samples selected by previous scholars to do empirical  study may become the main reason that the instable relationship existed between  the loss companies accounting earnings and stock price. This was first realized  by Satin(1992). He first put forward to divide samples into the continuous  operation of the company and the company going bankrupt in accordance that  future loss number is less than two times or redundant two classifications  after the current loss. He studied the value relevance of accounting earnings for  all kinds of loss companies. Since then, scholars had done the in-depth aspects  of study the concept, features and classification of the dimension of the loss  heterogeneity.<br>
  Martikainen(1997)  realized this loss may increase the risk of failure about the company's bankruptcy  when the temporary loss becomes into a permanent loss. He found that some  accounting earnings (such as permanent partial) reflected the information of  the future cash flow and other information (such as transitory earnings)  couldn&rsquo;t reflect the information of the future cash flow based on the research  samples of American stock market. Therefore, the stock price only reflects the  permanent earnings, not including the temporary earnings. Further, Martikainen(1998)  selected the Finland stock market data and employed the event study method to compare  the information content of accounting loss and profit between accounting  earnings and stock returns, and he found the relationship between the existing  accounting losses was weakened. Finally he draw a conclusion: if the market is  rational and effective, it will not make price reaction to the temporary  component of the accounting earnings because the temporary loss will not happen  again in future years, and cannot enter the model of stock price of the discounted  future cash flow of stock pricing. So the stock pricing will not be affected, however,  the permanent losses continuing into the future will have a significant impact  on stock prices. While low information content of the loss depends on the  transient of the loss. Ashiq Ali and Paul Zarowin (1992) further thought, i.e. stronger  non-expected earnings persistence was, higher the corresponding ERC was.  Obviously, permanent earnings represent the company future sustained  profitability, but temporary accounting earnings and accounting earnings without  the relation with price not to bring future expected cash flow for the company.  Therefore, in the information view (with a valid market premise), investors  will be treated differently in different persistent earnings, i.e., more strong  the company earnings persistence is in the same condition, more strong the  market reaction to the company's stock will be.<br>
  Sustained  loss allows investors to expect transient loss and permanent loss &quot;heterogeneous&quot;,  and then it affects the stock price of loss companies. Considering the heterogeneity  of the loss, Jenkins(2003) divided the loss companies into four different kinds  of ruin probability in accordance with the possibility of  bankruptcy, and conducted regression analysis respectively. The result  showed that with the increase of the probability of bankruptcy, the expected  earnings of persistent earnings per share had a declined tendency. That is to say,  there is significantly positive correlation between their persistent earnings  and equity value for those expected surviving loss listed corporations; but there  is more relevant between their liquidation value and equity value for those  expected bankruptcy loss listed corporations. Then, Joos and Plesko(2005) divided  loss corporations into permanent loss and transient loss by using a loss  reversal model. Those temporary loss companies have higher firm value due to the larger opportunities of loss reversibility and have a  lower likelihood of executing the liquidation option; and the value of those permanent  loss companies was decided by their liquidation value because they have real financial  difficulties and have lower opportunities to reverse loss which resulted in that  most of them exercised likely liquidation option. In addition, through the  analysis of time series, Joos and Plesko found the increasing frequency of the occurrence  of a negative cash flow and R &amp; D expenditure component in loss firms with  the passage of time during the value assessment of the persistent loss companies.  This conclusion confirmed that the loss companies' value is a function about loss  persistency and also developed the find of the Givoly and Hayn(2000) about &quot;The  falling profitability in USA Inc is not associated with the decline of the cash  flow over the same period &quot;, which thought that cash flow was the decisive  factor in the growth of the intrinsic value of loss companies, especially for  those persistent loss companies. Even though these studies consider the loss of  heterogeneity, they didn&rsquo;t discuss some driving factors of their intrinsic  value of the different types of loss companies from the eyesight of investor&rsquo;s  expectancy.<br>
  With the  increasing of loss companies in the stock market, it is very important to understand  the characteristics of loss companies and how to evaluate the loss companies for  investors. Raul, Francisco and Pablo(2006) assess the future profitability of  loss companies and determine whether the loss firms are supported by investors or  not according to analysts&rsquo; forecast. In order to measurement the degree of investors&rsquo;  support for the loss companies, they construct five dummy variables based on  the analysts&rsquo; forecast data: (1) the variable to measure that the target price of  the loss companies was higher or lower than the actual price. They assumed that  those firms that the target price was higher than the actual price would be  supported by the analysts. So those firms would be expected to be improved and would  be very likely profitable in the near future. (2) the variable to measure that  whether the mean of loss companies' anticipated earnings is positive. They  assumed that those companies who were supported in a short term were those companies  which were expected to have positive earnings last year. (3)the variable to measure  the relations among the quality and quantity by analysts&rsquo; recommendation, and they  were assumed that those companies which were recommended for holdings or buying  by analysts were better than those recommended for selling or reduction. (4)the  variable to measure that whether the composite score of analysts&rsquo; recommendations exceeds the  critical point of the mean. They classified all loss firms according  to their value and summarized and scored all analysts&rsquo; comments to various loss  firms. They didn&rsquo;t only consider how many recommendations the analysts put  forwards, but also takes into account the intensity of analysts' recommendations.  (5)the variable to measure that whether the market-book ratio exceeds the  critical point of the mean. They assumed that those firms that there is a big  difference between the market value and book value would be considered to improve  their earnings in the future by investors, while those firms whose the  price-to-book ratio is very close to one were not considered to be optimistic by  investors. Eventually, they set a variable to summarize the support degree by  analysts and investors, and whereby the loss companies were grouped to study. Considering  the difference of the support degree among several groups from completely not  support to fully support, the loss companies should be evaluated using various  methods.<br>
  Similarly,  considering of the expectancy of investors to the persistence of losses, Kevin  (2010) divided loss companies into various types in accordance with the size of  expected seasonal surplus. The group with the lowest persistence of the seasonal  earnings was expected as permanent loss group, and the group with the  highest persistence of the seasonal earnings was expected as transient loss  group. His results showed that investors will not completely distinguish the differences  in loss persistence identified by the model. On the contrary, they seemed to  assume that all losses would be transient. Therefore, investors were surprised at  the disclosure of future negative earnings predicted by the model for  persistent loss companies, these companies had significant negative abnormal  return in the following four quarter, but the abnormal returns were almost zero  for those transient loss companies. The reason was that the investors underestimate  the persistence of losses, not to panel the loss companies with poor  performance up to most.<br>
  Thus,  scholars&rsquo; studies based on the loss heterogeneity on the value of loss  companies were still at a preliminary stage, especially on the concept of loss  heterogeneity, and most scholars only focus on the loss heterogeneity in one or  two dimensions.</p>
<h1 align="center"> Driving factors and driving mechanism of the value  of loss companies</h1>
<p>Accompanied  the deeply study on loss heterogeneity of loss firms by the scholars, the explanations  for changing in value of loss companies seeking by the people has become more  comprehensive and rich. Early scholars mainly analyze the impact on the loss  company&rsquo;s value from some driving factors on internal perspective including the  dividend policy, loss occurrence frequency and the companies&rsquo; size. For example,  Harry Deangelo, Linda Deangelo and Douglas J. Skinner (1992) think the  information that whether the dividends was cut or not will enhance the ability  of the company to predict future earnings according to the current earning when  the company occurs to make a loss, because the signal transfer mechanism will  eventually lead to the fluctuation of the stock price for this kind of companies.  Teppo Martikainen, Juha-Pekka Kallunki and Jukka Perttunen (1997) think that the  different methods of earnings measurement will affect the frequency of the occurrence  to make a loss, and then change the relationship between profit and returns.  This shows that the frequency of loss will influence the value of the  companies. And the higher the frequency, the amplitude of the fluctuations in  the value of loss companies is greater. Rayburn (1987) found that many special  elements (such as the size of the company, the growth and debt risk) can cause the  value change of the loss companies. Easton  and Zmijewski (1989) and Collins and Kothari (1989) also found that there is a  positive correlation between the value relevance of accounting earnings and  corporate size and growth, and there is a negative correlation between the  value relevance of accounting earnings and the beta coefficient. Internal  factors can explain why the value of loss companies will change to a certain  extent, but it cannot explain the phenomenon why those loss firms facing the  liquidation will still exist market value.<br>
  Give up  the option theory, the option to give up or liquidating owned by shareholders  will increase its current value of loss firms. Hayn (1995) firstly applied the  theory of abandon option into the valuation of loss firms. It is assumed that  the loss will not continue because the shareholders of the company have the  right to transfer their stocks in the second securities market. According to  this hypothesis, the shareholders will not easily give up their stocks even if the  listed corporation is in the loss situation as long as the market value of the loss  listed Corporation is not less than the liquidation value. The market value of loss  listed corporation includes two parts. One part is related with accounting  surplus value, and another part is its liquidation option value. The shareholders  will perform abandonment option when the value of loss listed corporation fallen  down into liquidation value due to a loss. Then the value of the company is  only decided by its liquidation value. The theory of abandonment option  considers the value of the loss listed corporations is determined not only by  the accounting earnings but also by the existing hidden option, but it only  takes into account an extreme case that bankruptcy and liquidation occurred in the  loss companies. The liquidation value per share proposed by Hayn is only on  behalf of the company's external adjustment value, and it is useful only when  the liquidations value of loss firm is higher than the internal assets adjusted  earnings. In other words, if the internal assets adjusted earnings are higher  than the liquidation value, then it is not appropriate to use the liquidation  value per share as the alternative variables of the adjustment value. In fact, it  is possible to save the company by transferring, recombinating and other more  common way when the listed corporation makes a loss. These phenomenons can apparently  not be explained by the abandonment option theory.<br>
  Burgstahler  and Dichev (1997) reconstructed the value evaluation model of loss listed corporation  in which they took book value as the surrogate variable of the adjusting value  of loss listed corporation. The model considered the value of loss listed  corporation to be composed by two complementary value, one is Recursion Value,  which is the sum of the present value of future earnings from continuing  operations assuming to be in accordance with the current fashion (dependent on  current business and technologies), another is Adaptation Value, which produced  when the resource independent of the current business and technology is changed  (including the assets of interior modulation and external adjustment ) , Adaptation  Value is on behalf of the right owned by the company to disposal various assets  by reconstructing(such as sale, transfer, clearing or reconfiguration etc.). The  liquidation or giving up referred by Hayn (1995) is only the extreme processing  mode in the adjusting situation mentioned by Burgstahler and Dichev(1997). The valuation  model takes into account more extensive option value including the value of adjustment  option and it also pays attention to the internal adjustment value and external  adjustment value, which makes it suitable for the valuation of loss firms that  interior modulation value is higher than the external adjustment value. From  this point of view, the adjusting option theory overcome the defects of  abandonment option theory which can only be used for the valuation of those be  liquidated. It can be simultaneously used to assessment normal values produced  by the expected earnings for valuation of loss companies in continuous  operation state and the internal and external adjustment value when changing in  the use of assets. Collins, Pincus and Xie (1999) use the equity book value as an  alternative variable of the abandonment option and predict future normal  surplus，and they found there is a negative correlation  between stock price of the loss company and earnings per share. And it is an unreasonable  negative correlation between the market price and earnings per share when removing  the influence of equity book value. This suggests that liquidation option  theory and adjust option theory proposed by previous scholars cannot fully  explain the market value of loss companies.<br>
  When the  company makes a loss or transient earning, the information about earnings has a  great influence on the possibilities of the violation of debt contract in view  of investors and has a little influence on the economic value of the company's  assets. For example, when R &amp; D product in a medicines-producing company  success to go through the certification of drug administration, the disclosure  of the information will set up the confidence of investors and greatly reduce  the possibility of the violation of debt contract. The company&rsquo;s equity market  value will be promoted. The change occurring in the equity optional value form  the change of the possibility is called &ldquo;contract&rdquo;effect by default option theory, this effect is obvious for those who  are large likely to default(including loss companies and transitory earning companies  especially). Core and Schrand (1999) considered the possibility of the  violation of debt contract and set up a model of executive option rights to the  companies with the liabilities. The model provides not only the information  about current and future expected cash flows but also the information of the  possibility of violation of debt contract. The empirical study shows that the  response of stock price to earnings would be enhanced when the company was  going to debt default, and there is a significant positive correlation between loss  or transient earnings and stock returns in those companies with lower assets. These  earnings significantly alter the likelihood of default, but do not provide the information  about future cash flow. It shows that the company's equity value is a nonlinear  function of earnings and book value. But it is the premise of the possibility  of the violation of debt contract in loss companies. In view of this, the  default option theory is powerful to explain the value of loss listed  corporations with a debt contract, but it is powerless to the value of loss  listed corporations without a debt contract.<br>
  Despite  the abandonment option, adjustment options and debt default option are able to  weaken the positive correlation between the market rights and earnings, but it  cannot be reduced to a negative correlation. The negative correlation in the  reality of the existence indicates the current larger amount of loss will  reverse to larger profits at a specified date in the future. Apparently, it is inadequate  to explain the negative correlation between market value and earnings by previously  option theory factors. Therefore, subsequent scholars further put forward their  opinions on this problem from the conservative accounting methods. Amir and Lev  (1996) found the value of intangible assets of loss companies in the wireless  communications industry can be evaluated by non-financial indicators (such as  the total number of staff in the service industry, market permeability and so  on). Securities market considers administrative expenses, sales expenses and depreciation  expenses to be an investment other than current expenditure as in conservative accounting  methods，so that it will not reduce the company's value.  Hand (2003) studies suggest there is a relation between the equity value in a  biotechnology company and their development costs and non cash assets. Masako  Darrough and Jianming Ye (2006) 's research shows that earnings (or equity book  value ) may not be sufficient to represent the company's future potential, and the  distortion of current accounting data maybe leads to the negative correlation  between the value of loss companies and the root of the current earnings.  Abandoning options and restructuring the option theory posit that loss  companies may bankruptcy or reorganization. In fact, this is only a probable  status for loss companies and some loss companies also will still continue to  live. Bankruptcy, liquidation, merger, acquisition by loss companies&rsquo; executive  abandonment option or reconstructure by external forces and so on, those will  make the company forever. But some loss companies will survive if the companies  conduct the internal restructuring options. He divided the loss companies into  different groups in accordance to the intensity of R &amp; D (= R &amp; D  expenditure / Sales) and study each group separately. The result shows that those  companies having more investment on R &amp; D bigger are more likely to  survive. Many loss companies have a huge investment on R &amp; D, their losses  were largely due to the accounting conservative principle, and namely, they  often put research and development expenditure into current expense. They think  those loss companies who continued to operate for many years have four potential  value driving factors: very spending, R &amp; D, growth strategy and the  probability of survive. These variables assumed that current poor performance  indicates the future potential profit opportunity, namely current losses will  become the future earnings, so the market has a good evaluation for this kind  of loss companies, which leads to the high value of the loss listed corporation.<br>
  It is  obvious that previous scholars&rsquo; research focus on how to interpret the weak  correlation between accounting earnings and stock price from the above all  kinds of valuation theories about loss listed corporations. Wherein, abandon  option theory, adjust the option theory and default option theory pays more  attention to the investors&rsquo; behaviors after making a loss, and focuses the  point from the effects of interior modulation method of the investor only to the  effect of external adjustment method from the option pricing models used by  them. These effects were considered to be a variety of options of loss listed  companies by these theories, and these options add the value of loss listed corporations.  Sales pricing theory and accounting conservatism theory focus on the whole  value of loss listed corporations, mainly analyze the value from the reasons  why they make a loss. And they consider sales growth, market development costs,  development costs and expenses to be main reasons and build the model to evaluate  the loss companies based on these reasons. These theories can explain the changes  in the value of loss listed corporations to certain extent, but they has failed  to fully and clearly explain and evaluate the integrity value of loss listed corporations.</p>
<h1 align="center">Loss reversibility  and the value of loss companies</h1>
<p>Because there is a correlation between the absolute level of earnings  and earnings persistence, abnormally large or small earnings may mean less  persistent, i.e. earnings exist a reversal phenomenon. Based on the liquation theory,  investors will delay the implementation of liquidation option behavior when  they think loss companies may be improved in the future. Especially for some  better listed corporations, investors are likely to give managers an  opportunity to reverse the loss when they make a loss. Then, the management can  cut costs, strip non-profit items and expand sales and other methods in order  to improve their performances or management can accumulate the post-annual loss  to current period one-time by taking a &ldquo;big bath&rdquo;, so that loss companies have  a more possibility of loss reversibility in the future. Watts (1986) further  recognized that this reversal possibility make the value relevance of  accounting earnings of the loss companies become very weak, and more the reversal  possibility is, the negative effect of loss on the stock price of loss listed corporation  is less. Samantha Sin and Edward Watts (2000) chose listed companies from 1983  to1993 in the Australian Stock Exchange as samples, and they studied the  company with financial health. They found the weak earnings response  coefficient to loss depended on the expectations of the shareholders on future  earnings and loss reversal because shareholders think these potential companies  can achieve profitability through the behavior of their management. In  addition, David Ashtona, Chen Limb, Mark Tippettc and Brian Wrightb (2005) thought  the value of loss companies will be affected by the potential real options related  to the capabilities of business reconstruction. And capabilities of business  reconstruction determine the possibility of loss reversal.<br>
  Apparently,  scholars are able to recognize loss reversibility is an important factor leading  to the changes of the value of loss companies. Most of the value driven factors  affect the value of loss companies by the transmission of the intermediary  variable of the loss reversibility. However, the understanding of the existing  research on the loss reversibility is not comprehensive. Most scholars only focus  on the probability of loss reversal of loss companies, while neglecting the  degree, authenticity, timeliness and other more important characteristics of loss  reversal. They are mainly embodied in the methods to measure the loss  reversibility. There are three kinds of methods to measure the loss  reversibility in the present research as following:<br>
  The  first method is to use the indicator variable to measure whether listed corporation  occur loss reversal. This method is adopted by most scholars (Joos and Plesko, 2005;  Jiang and Stark, 2006) currently. They are all through the establishment of two  kinds of random walk model to predict the loss reversibility. Usually loss reversibility  was set as indicator variable, and defined as: when loss companies profit in  the next period, the variable value is 1; when they continue to loss in the  next period, the variable value is 0. This article thinks that the method is  primarily concerned whether listed company will reverse in the first accounting  period after loss, without considering the possibility of loss reversal in the second  period, third period even longer after loss. In fact, loss reversal period of many  listed companies is not in the first period after loss, but in the longer period.  Furthermore, setting loss reverse as indicate variable only recognized whether loss  companies occur loss reversal in the next period, did not measure the degree of  loss reversal. But in fact, the differences of profitability ability will lead  to different degrees of their loss reversed. Therefore, the method of setting  loss reversibility as indicator variable only is obviously insufficient to analyze  listed companies&rsquo; loss reversal degree in-depth.<br>
  The  second method is to use the ratio of sum of earnings of all the loss period and  the loss amount of the first loss year to measure loss reversal probability of listed  companies. The method was proposed by Chambers (1996). They used the ratio of sum  of negative earnings&rsquo; present value of listed companies until loss year and the  loss amount of the first loss year to express the sustainability of listed companies&rsquo;  first loss. Negative earnings&rsquo; present value of loss period is discount  calculated by average bonds interest rate disclosed by Moodier Company.  According to this method, the first loss sustainability of single loss period  equal to 1, and the first loss sustainability of multiple loss period is larger  than 1. Therefore, smaller the first loss sustainability is, the degree of loss  reversal is greater. The article thinks, this method pay attention to single  loss period and multiple loss period at the same time, but with all the loss of  negative surplus value and the first loss annual amount of loss ratio of said  first loss in the continuous method more accurately measure only, who only made  its first loss of listing Corporation and occurrence of multiple losses but  many subsequent losses for the first time since the start of continuous losses  occurred, but if listing Corporation multiple losses since its first loss since  is discontinuous situation occurred, the measuring method can not truly measure  the first loss of continuity. In fact, multiple loss of most listed companies  is not continuous, but is often interrupted (Hany, 1995; Jiang and Stark, 2006).  Particularly in the security market of China, previous research of scholars (Zhang  Xin,2008; Xue Shuang,2009) showed that, because company's management has strong  motivation exempting from delisting and behavior tendency of earning  management, listed company is often loss at first and then profit，and  loss and then profit，and have been reciprocating. Therefore, the method is not suitable for  Chinese listed companies&rsquo; loss reversal measurement.<br>
  The  third method uses the earnings of next quarter to measure company's loss  reversibility. The method was proposed by Kevin (2010). He chose quarterly  earnings to predict future earnings of loss companies, and judge the loss  reversibility of the company by predicting future earnings. He thought  quarterly earnings forecast model was better than two random walk model and the  model assuming that all loss are transient. It greatly reduced the prediction error.  The reason is that the predicted earnings contain both information of loss  reversal and future earnings information. Despite the predicted earnings and  estimated loss reversal possibility are highly correlated (Pearson correlation  coefficient is 0.760), but the predicted earnings contains more information  about the future performance of the loss companies. This paper argues that, compared  to the first loss reversal method, quarterly earnings forecast model has two  advantages. First, quarterly earnings forecast value can intuitively reflect  the loss reversibility of listed company, which answered whether it can reverse.  Second, quarterly earnings forecast value itself reflects the degree of loss  reversal or loss continuity of listed company. If the predicted value is  positive, then its size reflects the reversal degree of loss of listed company  and illustrates its profitability ability; if the predicted value is negative,  then the size reflects the persistence degree of loss of listed company and  illustrates the severity of loss. The prediction method adopts rolling  prediction, therefore, it can be applied to the situation of Chinese listed company,  which appears first loss then profit and loss and profit and such reciprocating  intermittent loss, so that makes up for the insufficiency of the second measure  method of loss reversibility.</p>
<h1 align="center">Enlightenment  China  capital market</h1>
<p>Along  with our stock market becoming mature, domestic and international competition  becoming fierce increasingly, loss listed companies are unabated. Achievements of  foreign scholars in the value assessment of loss companies enrich the company  value assessment theory system, perfect China's delisting system and the  information disclosure system of listed company, guide investors and government  to carry out reasonable value judgment of the loss of listed company. </p>
<h2>Correctly understanding the  heterogeneity of loss companies</h2>
<p>Study of  loss heterogeneity is a new financial research field and still in the initial  stage. Especially scholars each airs his own view on the connotation of the  concept of loss heterogeneity, and most scholars only saw the loss  heterogeneity in one or two dimensions. Inconsistencies of concept of loss  heterogeneity will lead to scholars&rsquo; study losing transverse comparable  platform. Therefore, it should be established on the basis of clearing the connotation  of concept of loss heterogeneity in order to promote the theoretical research and  practical application of loss heterogeneity. So, it puts forward clearly  concept of loss heterogeneity: loss heterogeneity study is to analyze and  discuss the scale, industry attributes, loss history, loss reversal probability  of various loss companies and the resulting differences on loss information  content, loss sustainability, the degree of asymmetric information of investors,  analysts predict, managerial compensation and loss companies&rsquo; value, and so on.  Of course, the connotation of this concept still needs follow-up researchers  enriching and expanding constantly with the diversification of loss type and  the complex of loss companies&rsquo; environment, to adapt to the needs of new  environment and practice application.</p>
<h2>Unifying  dimensions of loss heterogeneity type </h2>
<p>Because  dimension of loss heterogeneity type is not consistent, it may lead to  phenomenon. of overlapping and omitting samples. Franzen (2002) presented loss  companies may be divided into investment loss, transient loss, reversible loss  and liquidation loss of four class based on loss sporadic and loss  reversibility. A careful analysis can discover the investment loss will be two  kinds of results: profit and loss, which the former essentially contains  partially reversible loss and the latter essentially contains some of  liquidation loss. The overlapping heterogeneous types will make the final  conclusion of the study is not exact and reliable. In addition, bilateral logic  model used by many scholars divided loss companies into continuous loss and  transient loss of two categories based on loss reversibility. But it ignored  the third states, namely the deleted samples from the database in the  subsequent year due to bankruptcy. Because of missing the loss company types  lost in later years when estimating loss reversal model, therefore, the model&rsquo;s  accuracy and usefulness will be overestimated. Therefore, future loss  heterogeneity research is necessary to establish in the uniform dimension. Of  course, it needs scholars to do further theoretical analysis and empirical  research about division loss heterogeneity being based on a single dimension,  two dimension or multiple dimensions. </p>
<h2> Reasonable selection of  measurement method of loss reversal.</h2>
<p> Based on the above comparative analysis of three  metric methods about loss reversal of the of the of capital market in China, considering  the particularity and Zhang Xin (2008)、Kevin (2010) mentioned quarter  earnings forecast method superiority, as well as most companies in the loss  after the first quarter will be more obvious and behavior, this paper argues  that it can choose the difference between quarterly earnings of the first quarter  after loss after assets standardization and annual net assets of the loss year after  assets standardization to illustrate the extent of the loss reversal. The  larger value shows the possibility and the extent of loss reversal of loss listed  company are greater. In addition, because cash flow can more truly reflect listed  company&rsquo;s loss status, many scholars&rsquo; study found that profit capacity of listed  company whose cash flow is more is stronger. It can also choose net operating cash  flow per share  Net operating cash flow  per shareNet operating cash flow per shareNet operating cash flow per share and  net cash flow per share in the loss year as auxiliary variables reflecting loss  reversal degree. In addition, taking into account the information timeliness of  the quarterly cash flow, as well as the exclusion of possible defects of accrual  measuring rate of return on assets on the measurement of loss reversal degree, we  can use the difference between net operating cash flow per share  Net operating cash flow per shareNet operating  cash flow per shareNet operating cash flow per share and net cash flow per  share in the loss year, between net operating cash flow per share in the first  quarter Net operating cash flow per shareNet operating cash flow per shareNet  operating cash flow per share after loss and net cash flow per share in the  loss year to show the authenticity of loss reversal. Such, we can comprehensively  measure the loss reversal of the company from loss reversal degree, timeliness,  truthfulness, for the foundations of better study about the relationship  between loss reversibility and firm value.<br>
  6.4  Paying attention to the influence of investor&rsquo;s expectation factors to the  value of loss company<br>
  The  former company value assessment is often limited to the use of the earnings per  share, net asset per share, operating cash flow per share and other traditional  financial index, but neglects the analysis to the liquidation value of listed company,  restructuring, significant related party transactions, equity division, debt  delay or reconciliation and other non-financial information. It is possible to  make the investors lose good investment opportunities. For the judgment of loss  listed company's value, investors should change the traditional investment  philosophy just looking at the sum of the present value of future cash flows of  its existing business, and pay more attention to the sum of present value of its  future investment opportunities. These future investment opportunities in  essence are real option of company holding, which will increase the loss companies&rsquo;  value, thus raise the stock price of loss listed company. In China's unique  system background, loss listed company often has many special trade  arrangements, which changes the expectations of investors, gives new  value&quot; selling point&quot; of the loss listed company, thus affecting the  stock price of loss company. Therefore, to price for the stock of loss listed company,  we should not consider single one or several aspects of factors, but should  stand in the angle of investor, considering various expected factors to explore  the driving path for all kinds of heterogeneity of loss listed company, thereby  make a reasonable assessment on the value of loss of listed company.</p>
